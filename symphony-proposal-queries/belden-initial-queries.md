Subject: Request for Technical Deep Dive on Eclipse Symphony Architecture
After reviewing the available documentation on blue-green deployments, I would appreciate a more comprehensive understanding of Symphony's architecture.
Specifically, I would like to request:
- A detailed architectural overview of Eclipse Symphony's core components and their interactions
- Information on the modularity and extensibility of Symphony components
- Details on how Symphony's controllers and orchestrators interface with underlying infrastructure
- Insights into the component replacement/customization capabilities
- Technical documentation on Symphony's state reconciliation mechanisms
- Performance considerations and scalability limits of the architecture

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.
Andrii
