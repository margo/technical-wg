### Minutes
The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings. The topics covered included: 

1. **Rest API Usage for Device Communication:**
   - **Proposal:** Use Rest API for device-to-cloud communication.
   - **Discussion Points:**
     - The majority approved the use of Rest API for its familiarity and widespread industry adoption.
     - Concerns about security and packet inspection were raised, especially in industrial environments where Http/Https protocols are preferred.
     - Alternative protocols like gRPC were discussed but were considered less favorable due to limited industry support and challenges in OT environments.

   - **Action Items:**
     - Define the Rest API further, considering security mechanisms.
     - Begin reference implementation for testing.

2. **GitOps for Desired State Management:**
   - **Proposal:** Utilize GitOps for storing and managing the desired state of deployments.
   - **Discussion Points:**
     - Flexibility and control offered by GitOps for versioning and rollback were highlighted.
     - Concerns were raised about interoperability and the complexity of implementing GitOps across various deployment scenarios.
     - Suggested creating an abstraction layer to allow for different methods (e.g., REST, curl) depending on the orchestration service used.
     - Alternatives like using standardized APIs without enforcing specific tools were considered.
   
   - **Action Items:**
     - Develop a prototype to compare different implementation approaches.
     - Define a clear deployment scenario and environment for testing.

3. **General Concerns and Next Steps:**
   - **Security Considerations:** Ensuring secure communication between devices and the orchestrator, especially when using different protocols.
   - **Testing and Prototyping:** Need for prototypes to evaluate proposed solutions in real-world environments.
   - **Documentation:** Clearly document expected deployment scenarios and use cases to guide development and testing.

   - **Action Items:**
     - Consolidate and share feedback received in the meeting.
     - Develop and test prototypes for both GitOps and REST API approaches.
