## Margo Workload Orchestration Agent Focus Group Meeting - 04 June 2024

### Attendees:
* Andreas Ziller (Siemens)
* Armand Craig (Rockwell Automation) - Chair
* Arne Broring (Siemens)
* Bart Nieuwborg (Rockwell Automation)
* Erik Nordmark (ZEDEDA)
* Himanshu Singh (Capgemini)
* Julien Duquesnay (Schneider Electric)
* Merrill Harriman (Schneider Electric)
* Philip Presson (ABB)
* Segev Ben Hayon (Schneider Electric)

### Minutes
The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev. The topics covered included: 

* Device Description/Capability File:
   - Armand presented a simplified version of the workload orchestration agent's initial onboarding component.
   - The device description file, renamed to device capability file, will inform the workload orchestration software of the deviceâ€™s capabilities and characteristics to enable smart workload deployment.

* CPU Details:
   - Discussion on including CPU architecture, VCPU count, CPU frequency, and potentially CPU model number in the device capability file.
   - Agreement on the need to list explicit CPU details rather than deducing them from model numbers.

* Memory, Storage, and Peripherals:
   - The inclusion of device peripherals such as GPU and network peripherals in the file.
   - Consensus on the importance of specifying peripheral type and model number for detailed and accurate device profiling.

* Device Roles:
   - Clarification on the advertisement of potential roles a device can take, such as cluster leader/worker.
   - Discussion on making the device roles align with previously defined device profiles and roles in the device requirements.

* Virtual Devices:
   - Consideration of how virtual devices should present their characteristics within the device capability file.
   - Agreement that the fields in the file should be adaptable to both physical and virtual devices.

* Unique Device Identification:
   - Emphasis on using a combination of model number and serial number to uniquely identify devices.
   - Discussion on the necessity of binding the device identity to security certificates to prevent spoofing.

* Peripheral Naming and Types: 
   - Importance of naming peripherals for clear identification.
   - Suggestion to include both name and type for each peripheral to avoid confusion and ensure completeness of the device profile.

**Open Items:**

   - Refine the proposal based on the feedback received.
   - Prepare a pull request (PR) for the updated device capability file and other related YAMLs.
   - Provide additional input on what fields should be mandatory and which ones can be optional for both physical and virtual devices.
   - Review the refined proposal once the PR is ready.
   - Continue the discussion on unique device identification and security aspects in subsequent meetings.
