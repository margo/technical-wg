### Summary Meeting Notes

The meeting focused on deploying applications to edge devices, comparing REST API and GitOps approaches. Key points included the need for a unique ID per deployment specification for tracking and verification, and the pros and cons of each method. Concerns were raised about the size and complexity of GitOps, particularly on resource-constrained devices. A breakout group was proposed to investigate these issues further. The team also discussed the importance of maintaining the last known state of deployments and the potential need for rollback functionality. The meeting concluded with plans to form breakout groups to refine these discussions.

### Minutes
**Discussion on Deployment Specifications and Unique IDs** -
Armand initiates the meeting by sharing the agenda and reviewing notes from previous meetings.
Armand emphasizes the need for a unique ID per deployment specification to enable tracking and verification.
The discussion revolves around ensuring each deployment specification is unique and not duplicated.
Armand clarifies that the unique ID is for each deployment specification, not the entire set of specifications for an edge device.

**Proposal for Using Hashes in REST API** -
Armand summarizes Eric's proposal to use hashes in HTTP GET and POST functions to retrieve deployment specifications.
The GET function would pull the initial set of deployment specifications, while the POST function would periodically check for updates.
Armand highlights concerns about replicating GitOps functionality with REST API, including multiple interfaces and IT approval.
The group discusses the pros and cons of using REST API versus GitOps for deployment specifications.

**Breakout Groups for Detailed Analysis** -
Merrill suggests that identifying the functionalities of GitOps is necessary to determine the feasibility of a REST implementation.
Christian proposes forming breakout groups to create detailed specifications for REST and GitOps approaches.
The breakout groups would help understand the minimum requirements and present concrete features for discussion.
Armand and Christian discuss the need for a pragmatic view of the required functionalities from GitOps.

**Liam's White Paper on Deployment Methods** -
Liam apologizes for missing the previous meeting and presents a white paper on deployment methods for Kubernetes.
The white paper compares different deployment methods, including CRDs and operators, and recommends using CRDs and operators with GitOps.
Liam offers to check in the white paper as a draft PR or upload it to the chat for review.
Armand and Merrill discuss the importance of focusing on a single customer journey to avoid complications.

**Concerns About Size and Complexity** -
Phil raises concerns about the size of GitOps repositories and the need for specific storage limits.
Merrill emphasizes the importance of understanding the ramifications of GitOps on edge devices, including network paths and service requirements.
The group discusses the need for a detailed investigation into the size and complexity of GitOps on-edge devices.
Armand notes the need to consider the attack surface and security implications of implementing GitOps on edge devices.

**Breakout Group Tasks and Next Steps** -
Armand suggests forming breakout groups to investigate the differences and ramifications of using GitOps versus REST API.
The breakout groups will focus on size, port requirements, and the work required to replicate GitOps functionality with REST.
Armand plans to schedule breakout group meetings to facilitate detailed discussions and findings.
The group agrees to pause the meeting and reconvene after the breakout groups have progressed.

**Finalizing Deployment Specifications and Requirements** -
Armand reiterates the need for a unique ID per deployment specification and user-defined versions for better tracking.
The group discusses the importance of ensuring devices can revert to the last known state in case of an outage.
Armand proposes that rollback functionality be a differentiating feature rather than a core requirement.
The group agrees to focus on the minimum requirements for deployment specifications and leave more advanced features for future releases.

**Closing Remarks and Next Meeting** -
Armand summarizes the key points discussed, including the need for breakout groups and the importance of focusing on core requirements.
The group agrees to reconvene after the breakout groups have made progress to finalize decisions.
Armand thanked everyone for their participation and outlined the next steps for the breakout groups.
The meeting concludes with a plan to reconvene after the breakout groups have provided their findings.

### Action Items 
- [ ] Form a breakout group to investigate and compare the REST-based and Git-based approaches for retrieving deployment specifications.
- [ ] Investigate the implications of the different approaches' size, security, and scalability.
- [ ] Determine the minimum requirements for the deployment specification, such as the ability to recover to the last known state.
- [ ] Update the deployment specification to include a user-defined version and a unique ID.
