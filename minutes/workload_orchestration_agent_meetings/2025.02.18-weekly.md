**Armand opens the meeting at 15:00 GMT**

### Summary Meeting notes
The meeting evaluated proposals for a REST API to manage application deployment states. Phil presented three proposals, each differing in handling desired state YAML files: one using a file, one with base64-encoded manifests, and one with a more declarative response. Silvano proposed using OCI distribution version 1.1 for simplicity and existing tooling. Another proposal emphasized HTTP compliance and content negotiation. The discussion highlighted the need to compare pros and cons, ensuring security, scalability, and interoperability. The team agreed to summarize the proposals and feedback for further evaluation.

**Proposal Presentations and Initial Setup**
Armand greets everyone and outlines the meeting's purpose: to evaluate proposals for a REST API following the decision to reject OpenGetOps. He highlights that the primary focus is on the interface between the fleet manager service and the workload orchestration agent. Armand posts the link to the proposals in the chat, noting that they can also be found in the meeting minutes. He then inquires if anyone would like to kick off the presentations, to which Phil volunteers.

**First Proposal: File-Based Desired State YAML**
Phil presents his initial proposal, which includes supplying the preferred state YAML through a file. The device requests a specific URL that reflects the current state hash ID. In reply, the fleet manager provides the hash ID, a list of app IDs slated for deletion, and a reference to the file holding the desired state YAML files. Phil showcases various scenarios, such as a brand-new device, a device lacking a current state, a device with new applications to deploy, and a device set to remove applications. The proposal comprises a tar.gz file that contains the desired state YAML files, and Phil notes that the specifics can be adjusted according to feedback.

**Second and Third Proposals: Base64 Encoded Manifest**
Phil presents his second and third proposals, which are similar but include base64 encoded application deployment YAML in the response. The device sends a request containing the current config ID and the hashes for the current applications, and the fleet manager replies with the desired config ID and the base64 encoded manifests for new or updated applications. Phil reviews the same scenarios, detailing how the device would manage different states and changes. The primary distinction is that the response payload includes the actual desired state YAML files, simplifying the process for the device to implement the changes.

**Feedback and Next Steps**
Armand and Merrill discuss creating a pros and cons spreadsheet to evaluate the proposals. Armand agrees but raises concerns regarding this document's practicality and potential effectiveness. He emphasizes recording the rationale behind decisions and summarising options for improved analysis. Armand plans to send a summary email and a link to the problem statement to gather additional feedback.

**OCI Distribution Version 1.1 Proposal**
Silvano presents his proposal, which is based on the specification of the OCI distribution version 1.1. The proposal aims to distribute desired state files using reliable tools and infrastructure, such as container registries. Silvano emphasises the proposal's simplicity and declarative nature, which relies on existing APIs and libraries. Armand inquires about what would be stored in the OCI registry. Silvano explains that it could be individual YAML files or a single file containing everything.

**Input on API and Payload Standardization**
Andre underscores the significance of standardising the API and the payload to ensure interoperability within the Margot stack. Armand concurs and mentions establishing a sound state for the API and payload before deciding. He plans to summarise the proposals, their differences, and the requirements in an email. Armand welcomes further proposals and feedback from the team.

**Last Proposal: HTTP Compliance and Content Negotiation**
The final proposal suggests making the desired configuration available as a list of files over HTTP, featuring additional HTTP capabilities for content negotiation and caching. This proposal supports HTTP/1.1 and promotes HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 for enhanced performance. The response payload includes download URLs, integrity strings, local paths, and versioning information for each file. The device is tasked with checking integrity and applying the files to ensure the desired state is attained.

**Final Discussion and Next Steps**
Armand summarises the consensus on the desired state, focusing on pattern recognition and emphasising the importance of security, open specifications, and scalability. He plans to coordinate notes and send a detailed summary email. Merrill suggests reviewing the use cases to ensure they are comprehensive and complete. Armand agrees and mentions the need to discuss the next steps, such as prototyping or further refining the list of proposals.

### Action Items
- [ ] Summarize the proposals and their key differences and share them with the group so that we can help with further feedback and decision-making.
- [ ] Link to the problem statement and existing requirements to help evaluate the proposals against them.
- [ ] Reach out to Carl individually to provide some historical context on the rationale behind the edge-pulling model versus a more CD-centric approach.
- [ ] Encourage the group to provide feedback on the proposals through comments in the markdown files or other channels.
