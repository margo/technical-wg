**Armand opens the meeting at 15:00 GMT**

### Summary Meeting Notes
The meeting centred on updates regarding the Walla interface and the consolidation of proposals. Silvano shared updates, stressing the significance of defining the desired state and utilizing REST APIs. Avasa suggested broadening the replication of the desired state to enable push-based management, highlighting advantages such as enhanced control over execution order and improved scalability. Participants expressed concerns about the feasibility of push models in environments with intermittent connectivity and emphasized the necessity for a flexible specification to cater to different deployment scenarios. The conversation underscored the importance of interoperability, the need for a unified reference architecture, and the potential dangers of overly rigid specifications.

### Minutes
**Review of Proposal Updates and Feedback**
Armand opens the meeting by emphasising last week's consolidated proposals and feedback. He highlights specific agenda points, such as updates from Silvano and anticipated insights from Vassa. Armand outlines the plan to address the next steps for finalising and aligning the preview release with the proposed reference implementation architecture. He then invites Silvano to provide his updates on the proposal.

**Silvano's Presentation on Proposal Updates**
Silvano presents his updates by sharing his screen, concentrating on architectural aspects. He underscores the significance of clearly defining the proposal's scope, stressing the desired outcome and the necessary resources for its attainment. Silvano elaborates on utilizing REST APIs to achieve the desired state while distinguishing between the API and the payload. He points out the critical nature of both internal and external triggers in verifying the desired state and the function of signals in this process.

**Discussion on Triggering and API Compatibility**
Erik expresses concerns regarding external triggers in environments that involve proxies and similar challenges. Silvano outlines that the proposal primarily addresses internal triggers and the utilization of REST APIs to maintain compatibility with OCI registries. Erik raises questions about the syntax and security concerns related to using tags in OCI URLs. Silvano further explains the adoption of digests to guarantee compatibility and highlights the possible need for tag resolution.

**Security and Implementation Concerns**
Erik addresses the security aspects of tag resolution, stressing the need for immutable references. Silvano recognizes these concerns and proposes solutions such as utilizing signatures for manifests. Erik underscores the necessity of a reference implementation that accommodates devices with occasional connectivity. Silvano concurs, pointing out the requirement for a protocol that manages both internal and external triggers.

**Feedback from Avasa on Push-Based Management**
Avasa proposes enhancing the replication of the desired state, enabling push-based management. To lessen the frequency of protocol sessions, Avasa suggests differentiating the agent call-home process from the desired state replication. Avasa highlights the benefits of push-based management, including improved control over the order of configuration changes and enhanced scalability. Avasa identifies the limitations of pull-based models, such as their reliance on complete forms and the difficulty of executing urgent updates swiftly.

**General Feedback and Concerns**
Avasa highlights the significance of supporting bi-directional calls while maintaining a carefully designed security strategy. They believe the existing specifications may be overly restrictive, potentially limiting both innovation and interoperability. Avasa advocates for a more adaptable strategy that permits various methods of achieving the desired state. Furthermore, they recognize the necessity for ongoing discussions and possible revisions to the specification.

**Discussion on Interoperability and Specification Level**
Erik highlights the importance of interoperability and the need for a cohesive strategy in managing devices from different vendors. He shares insights from previous projects to underscore the scalability and reliability of pull-based systems. Erik notes the challenges that push-based models encounter when connectivity is inconsistent, stressing the necessity of robust protocols. He suggests gathering further insights and disseminating them to inform the specification and implementation processes.

**Conclusion and Next Steps**
Armand summarises the discussion and acknowledges the need for further exploration and lessons learned. He suggests creating a common space for sharing past experiences and example architectures. Armand invites additional feedback and thoughts on the way forward, emphasising the importance of establishing interoperability and avoiding overly prescriptive specifications. The meeting concludes with a plan to revisit the discussion next week and continue refining the proposal and feedback.

### Action Items
