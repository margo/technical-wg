> Armand opens the meeting at 15:00

### Summary Meeting Notes
The meeting focused on the decision to use a REST API to retrieve the desired state from fleet managers rather than mandating GET infrastructure. Armand proposed a deadline for tech leads to vote on this decision. Sega demonstrated a device agent prototype that handles deployment specs, including installation, updates, and uninstallation of multiple container deployments. The prototype uses Docker Compose YAML files and a shared volume mechanism for user-provided resources. Discussions highlighted the need for security measures and the potential addition of a list data type for user input. The prototype will be integrated with the REST API and uploaded to the device requirements working group repository.

### Meeting Minutes

**REST API Decision and Prototype Demonstration**
Armand opens the meeting by outlining the agenda, which centres around the decision regarding the REST API and a prototype demonstration from Sega. He stresses the importance of determining whether to utilize the REST API or GET functions to obtain the fleet manager's desired state. The team agreed to adopt the REST API for state retrieval without requiring GIT infrastructure. Armand points out that fleet managers can use GET if preferred, but the REST API will manage the retrieval process.

**Clarification on REST API Implementation**
Christian questions whether the vote on the REST API decision will occur after the presentations. Armand clarifies that the ballot will finalize the discussion about mandating GET infrastructure. Deepak asks if the REST API will facilitate application deployment, and Armand assures him that it will retrieve deployment specifications. Erik wants to know if fleet managers can utilize GET, and Armand verifies that they can, but the REST API will manage the retrieval process.

**Prototype Demonstration by Sega**
Armand passes the presentation to Sega, who showcases a device agent designed for standalone devices. Sega outlines the setup, which includes a browser, Visual Studio, and a terminal linked to the same device. The device agent retrieves artefacts from a Docker factory and implements them on the standalone device. Sega illustrates deploying an Nginx web server, which allows for customizable options such as background colour and images.

**Detailed Prototype Demonstration**
Sega demonstrates the device agent's ability to identify new deployment files and retrieve the required images and configurations. The agent manages the installation, upgrade, and removal of deployments. Sega emphasizes the importance of a method for transferring user-supplied images via a shared volume. The demo showcases the agent's functionalities by upgrading a deployment with a new file and uninstalling another deployment.

**Discussion on Deployment Specification and Security**
Armand and Sega discuss the deployment specifications and the necessity of a package location file. Silvano proposes a minimalist strategy for the proof of concept (POC) and stresses the significance of security. Sega elaborates on the existing security protocols offered by GitHub and Docker Hub. The team decides to discuss security concerns separately and explore further options for the complete package.

**Complex Deployment and User Input**
Sega illustrates the deployment of various containers with distinct parameters and images. The device agent manages several services along with their respective environment variables. Sega recommends incorporating a list data type into the deployment specification to enhance user input flexibility. Phil and Sega converse about the requirement for a selection validation rule and the organization of variables within the deployment specification.

**Final Remarks and Next Steps**
Armand thanks Sega for the demo and proposes uploading the prototype components to the device requirements working group repository. Tom recommends setting up a landing page on the Margo website to direct users to active prototypes. Armand concurs and refreshes the Margo.org landing page with links to the active prototypes. Additionally, Armand intends to email tech leads with a deadline for voting on the REST API decision to finalize the issue.

### Action Items
- [ ] Prompt the tech leads to vote on the decision to use a REST API to retrieve the desired state specification within a week.
- [ ]  Upload the device agent prototype to the Device Requirements Working Group repository.
- [ ]  Discuss the additional prototype from Michael and Silvano in the next meeting.
