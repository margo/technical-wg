## Margo Workload Orchestration Agent Focus Group Meeting - 28 May 2024

### Attendees:
* Dr. Amir Varastehhajipour (Siemens)
* Armand Craig (Rockwell Automation) - Chair
* Arne Broring (Siemens)
* Merrill Harriman (Schneider Electric)
* Michael Sanchez (Schneider Electric)
* Philip Presson (ABB)
* Segev Ben Hayon (Schneider Electric)
* Himanshu Singh (Capgemini)

### Minutes
The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev. The discussion broadly covered: 

*  Device Capability YAML Structure:
   - Armand discussed the importance of defining a logical path to the file, suggesting a directory structure such as `devices/abc123/capability.yaml`.
   - Himanshu emphasized the need for input from the orchestration team regarding the pool of attributes, which vary in dynamism and complexity.

* Deployment Spec:
   - The importance of defining multiple sources within the YAML for flexibility was highlighted, e.g., `hello_world`, `hello_world_database`.

* Desired State Config Retrieval:
   - Two approaches were discussed: using an API or following an open source GitOps approach
   - Himanshu noted the flexibility of the API approach, while Armand pointed out the defacto standardization benefits of GitOps.

* Deployment Status:
   - Armand introduced a sample YAML structure for deployment status, including error codes and status updates.
   - The logical path for this file would be similar to other structures

**Open Items:**

* Directory Structure and File Paths:
   - Establish a standardized directory structure for device capabilities, deployment specs, desired state configs, and deployment statuses.
   - Armand to create example directory structures and file paths in the GitHub repository.

* Define Pool of Attributes:
   - Himanshu to coordinate with the orchestration team to finalize the pool of attributes needed for device capabilities.

* Open GitOps vs API Approach:
   - Further discussion and decision-making needed on whether to standardize on the Open GitOps approach or to use a flexible API approach for desired state config retrieval.

* Issue Creation:
   - Armand to create GitHub issues this afternoon to track the discussion points and action items.
