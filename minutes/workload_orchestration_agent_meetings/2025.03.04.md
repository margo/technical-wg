### Summary Meeting Notes
The meeting focused on gathering feedback regarding API proposals for workload orchestration. Armand emphasized the importance of a declarative API pattern and proposed renaming the workload orchestrator to a fleet manager. Major concerns included the atomicity and idempotency of API actions, the necessity for additional files apart from YAML, and the practicality of using OCI for managing and distributing desired states. Among the proposed solutions were leveraging OCI for multiplexing and maintain keep-alive connections, along with considering HTTP/2 for enhanced performance. The group agreed to reconvene next week to refine the API strategy further and tackle specific use cases.

### Minutes
**Feedback on API Proposals and Consolidation**
Armand thanks everyone for feedback on the API proposals and for highlighting recurring themes. He intends to compile this feedback into a comprehensive document for a more straightforward review. The objective is to create a unified API pattern or strategy within the TWG. The specification will be enhanced by including existing components such as deployment specs, YAML, and device capabilities.

**Declarative API and Fleet Manager**
Armand stresses the importance of implementing an utterly declarative API. He suggests renaming the workload orchestrator to 'fleet manager' to define the device's desired state. He addresses the ambiguity regarding whether files represent separate workloads or a complete set for the device. The state-seeking API must be idempotent and atomic, guaranteeing consistent outcomes with repeated actions.

**Concerns About Atomicity and Device Connectivity**
Phil worries about the API's atomicity, particularly for devices that connect sporadically. James points out that the API’s interaction with the cloud differs from how device states are retrieved. Armand and Andre examine the distinctions between Kubernetes and the suggested fleet manager. Andre proposes that Kubernetes is a specification that could work with the suggested fleet manager.

**Desired State via Application Hash**
Armand elaborates on the proposed desired state through an application hash and a unique manifest ID. When dealing with numerous workloads, Schneider worries about the possible size of the response. Julien emphasizes the importance of precisely defining the desired state that encompasses all necessary files. Andre recommends utilizing config maps in Kubernetes for supplementary files.

**Desired State as a File**
Armand addresses the idea of downloading the desired state as a file. Phil highlights the need for more file types beyond YAML, such as policy files and credentials. Julien proposes that the device download only the files that have changed to enhance data transfer efficiency. Merrill stresses the necessity of including app vendors in the conversation to address their requirements.

**OCI Desired State Proposal**
Andre introduces the OCI desired state proposal, highlighting the importance of multiplexing and keep-alive connections. The objective is to separate the workload orchestrator from the storage of desired states and payloads. He also notes supporting various storage solutions such as Git, OCI, and NFS. The proposal seeks to eliminate polling by implementing an event-based architecture for real-time updates.

**Feedback on OCI Desired State Proposal**
Phil endorses using OCI while highlighting the importance of compatibility with current tools like Argo and Flux. Stefan clarifies that the same registry applies to various payloads, including configurations for Argo and Flux. The proposal seeks to eliminate the need for custom solutions and to provide support for existing tools. Armand and Andre discuss the necessity of a reference network architecture to guarantee compatibility across different environments.

**Conclusion and Next Steps**
Armand consolidates the feedback and intends to distribute the document for additional review. The team decided to continue the discussion next week to finalize the API strategy. Armand will collaborate with Bart and Sean to facilitate feedback between meetings. The meeting wraps up with an agreement to copy and paste the chat messages into the document to preserve all information.

### Action Items
- [ ] Consolidate feedback on API proposals and present a summary.
- [ ]Discuss handling additional files beyond the deployment YAML that applications may require.
- [ ] Explore scenarios for using OCI registries and persistent connections to avoid polling.
- [ ]Share the consolidated feedback document for further discussion between meetings.
- [ ] Resume discussion on API proposals next week.
