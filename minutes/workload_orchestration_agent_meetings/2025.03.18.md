**Armand opens the meeting at 15:00 GMT**

### Summary Meeting Notes

The meeting addressed technical and strategic issues concerning the Margo project, highlighting updates on the Avassa and OCI registry proposals. The team debated the feasibility of mutual TLS for industrial automation, weighing alternatives like regular TLS with signed messages. They emphasised the necessity for a reference implementation to test core functionalities across various network environments, aiming to balance extensibility with interoperability while focusing on key options for initial development and testing.
### Action Items
 - [ ] Hashi to explain how they orchestrate campaigns and state seeking within Symphony.
 - [ ] Provide a write-up on the experiences with handling enterprise proxy and DDoS protection challenges.
 - [ ] Review Eric's semantic sequence pushover poll mechanism write-up.
 - [ ] Decide on 2-3 generic options for the external team to build reference implementations.
 - [ ] Collaborate on providing more detailed reference architecture diagrams, including network and software views, to help the group better understand the nuances.

### Meeting Minutes

**Agenda Overview and Initial Discussions** -
Armand introduces the agenda, covering lessons learned submissions, updates to the Avassa proposal, and feedback on the OCI registry proposal. He emphasises the necessity of discussing the next steps and security topics in Discord. Erik then addresses the challenges of mutual TLS in enterprise environments, including issues with proxies and DDoS protection. He explains the complexities of its deployment in real-world scenarios, highlighting the need for alternative solutions.

**Challenges with Mutual TLS and Enterprise Proxies** -
Erik discusses the challenges of mutual TLS in enterprise environments, particularly the necessity to bypass enterprise proxies. He suggests using regular TLS without client authentication, complemented by signed messages for security. His frustrations with mutual TLS in industrial automation underscore the urgent need for alternative solutions.

**Feedback on Alternatives and Proposals** -
Armand discusses additional feedback and contributions regarding wall alternatives. Carl highlights that Avassa has a forthcoming write-up addressing perceived shortcomings in mutual TLS. Erik and Carl further explore the challenges of deploying mutual TLS in enterprise environments, emphasising the need for pragmatic solutions and sharing lessons learned from various deployments.

**Discussion on API Design and Implementation** -
Armand and Carl discuss the API's scope, emphasising the need to balance core functionality with extensibility. Erik suggests concentrating on a core API that allows for additional features. The group agrees on the importance of a reference implementation to test the API across different environments, and Armand highlights the necessity of clear direction for the external team to build these implementations based on community feedback.

**Balancing Core Functionality and Extensibility** -
Armand and Carl discuss balancing core functionality with extensibility to meet customer requirements. Erik proposes concentrating on a core API that allows for additional functionalities. The group agrees on the significance of a reference implementation for testing the core API across various environments, highlighting the need for clear guidance for the external team based on community feedback.

**Next Steps and Action Items** -
Armand outlines the steps for onboarding an external product owner and development team. The group discusses the need for a clear direction for the external team to create reference implementations based on community feedback. Armand emphasises the importance of testing these implementations in various environments to validate the core API. The group agrees to continue discussions and refine proposals based on community feedback and real-world testing.
