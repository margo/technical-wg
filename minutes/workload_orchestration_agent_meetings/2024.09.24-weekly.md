### Minutes

**Summary note**

The meeting focused on implementing GitOps and REST API for device management. 
Key points included the approval of the REST API and the creation of an open API definition. 
The team discussed using GitOps for storing desired states and the benefits of traceability and delta updates. 
Concerns were raised about the size of Git repositories and the need for delta compression. 
The team agreed on the importance of a clear workflow and the potential use of REST API for onboarding and deployment status communication. 
A hybrid approach combining GitOps and REST API was considered, focusing on balancing functionality and implementation complexity.

**Discussion on REST API and GitOps Implementation**
Armand discusses the approval of the REST API and the next steps, including creating an open API definition and working on a server using Node.js. 
Armand announces the next steps for a reference implementation of the REST API and seeks comments from the team.
Armand raises a significant issue about the best way to interface with the source control infrastructure, specifically discussing the use of GitOps patterns. 
Armand suggests that those proposing alternatives to GitOps should present them for discussion, emphasizing the need to see potential options.

**Clarification on GitOps and REST API Workflows**
Andreas questions the workflow with GitOps, seeking clarification on the message format and functionality.
Stephen suggests drawing workflows to help decide on combining GitOps and REST API.
Armand clarifies that GitOps is suitable for providing the desired state to devices, while REST API is better for onboarding and deployment status communication.
Stephen raises concerns about the size of Git repositories and the need for delta compression to minimize data transfer.

**Detailed Discussion on GitOps and REST API Advantages**
Armand explains the use of GitOps between the orchestrator and devices, highlighting the advantages of open-source implementations like Flux or Argo.
Merrill questions the continuous monitoring of the Git repository by devices and the lack of an event channel for updates.
Stephen discusses GitOps' advantages, including traceability and delta updates, and suggests a hybrid approach combining GitOps and REST API.
Julien and Stephen discuss the potential issues with multiple repositories and the need for a single repository per device.

**Considerations for Device Management and Deployment**
Armand and Stephen discuss the challenges of managing multiple applications on a single device and the need for a precise deployment specification.
Stephen questions how the orchestrator manages the Helm chart repository and the need for updates.
Armand suggests using proxies to redirect to local registries without changing the Helm chart.
Armand and Stephen discuss the potential complexity of implementing GitOps and the need for a clear decision on the deployment specification.

**Comparison of GitOps and REST API Implementations**
Stephen emphasizes the importance of understanding the workflow and the advantages of GitOps, including traceability and delta updates.
Julien suggests comparing the advantages and inconveniences of both GitOps and REST API to make an informed decision.
Armand and Stephen discuss the potential security concerns with GitOps and the need for a custom REST API.
Armand agrees to compile updated diagrams and pros and cons for the next meeting to facilitate a better decision.

**Action Items**
- [ ] All - Compile the pros and cons of GitOps versus REST implementation and present them next week.
- [ ] Stephen - Prepare a sequence diagram or workflow to illustrate the multiple application scenarios and how the device would monitor and pull updates.
- [ ] All - Review the discussion and provide additional internal feedback for next week's meeting.
