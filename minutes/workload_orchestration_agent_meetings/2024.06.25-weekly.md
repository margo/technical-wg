### Minutes
The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings. The topics covered included: 

* Deployment Spec and Communication Patterns:
   - Armand Craig discussed finalizing a pull request for the deployment spec, which includes defining the deployment process and the application deployment spec.
   - Two primary approaches for communication between the agent and the workload orchestration software were discussed: GitOps approach and Margo API approach.
   - Pros and cons of both approaches were outlined, with key considerations for security, auditability, and maintainability.
* Deployment Profile and Application Package:
   - Deployment profiles were discussed, including the use of Helm and Docker Compose.
   - The deployment spec includes parameters for defining deployment profiles and application packages.
   - Discussion on ensuring consistent naming and structure across different deployment approaches (Helm and Docker Compose).
* Security Considerations:
   - Importance of evaluating security implications for both GitOps and API approaches.
   - Potential complexity in securing GitOps due to the involvement of a Git repository.
* Deployment Status and Reporting:
   - Need for clear reporting and status updates on deployment, especially in scenarios where the device has not connected for an extended period.
   - Discussion on the use of OpenTelemetry (OTEL) for status reporting and the challenges of implementing status updates using GitOps.

**Open Items:**

   - Armand Craig to finalize the pull request for the deployment spec and upload it for review later in the day.
   - Ensure examples for both Helm and Docker Compose approaches are included in the spec.
   - Provide feedback on the deployment process and any additional parameters required.
   - Review and provide feedback on the communication patterns discussed.
   - Consider additional pros and cons from the older Excel sheet and include them in the issue for better decision-making.
   - Evaluate the security implications for both GitOps and API approaches.
   - Ensure the complexity of the security solution is considered in the final decision.
   - Merrill Harriman to consult with application developers and provide feedback on the deployment spec and the proposed communication patterns.
   - Armand Craig to finish setting up the repositories in the Argo repo and send out the link for access.
