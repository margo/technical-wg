## Margo Workload Orchestration Agent Focus Group Meeting - 18 June 2024

### Attendees:
* Dr. Amir Varastehhajipour (Siemens)
* Andreas Ziller (Siemens)
* Armand Craig (Rockwell Automation) - Chair
* Arne Broring (Siemens)
* Deepak Gunjal (Capgemini)
* Himanshu Singh (Capgemini)
* Julien Duquesnay (Schneider Electric)
* Philip Presson (ABB)

### Minutes
The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings. The topics covered included: 

* Deployment Specification Overview: 
   - Armand Craig provided a detailed overview of the deployment specification.
   - Key elements discussed included the agent assignment, cluster and namespace configurations, and deployment initialization.
* Namespaces and Configuration Files:
   - Discussion on the differentiation between workload namespace and cluster namespace.
   - Importance of including Helm chart values in the deployment spec for Kubernetes cluster applications.
* Status of Deployment:
   - Armand introduced a simple five-stage status model for deployment: Created, Prepared, Downloading, Configuration, and Deployed.
   - Acknowledged the need to potentially expand this model as implementation progresses.
* Device Capabilities:
   - Emphasis on querying device capabilities to validate deployment specifications.
   - Example capabilities include memory, CPU resources, disk space, and device architecture.
   - Discussed the granularity needed for resource specification.
* Orchestration Engine:
   - Introduction of the orchestration engineâ€™s role in converting deployment specs into deployment manifests for Kubernetes or Helm charts.
   - Mentioned collaboration with Patrick to enhance the orchestration engine and ensure compatibility with multiple orchestration systems.

**Open Items**
   - Armand to clarify the differentiation between workload namespace and cluster namespace in the documentation.
   - Armand to add a section for Helm chart names and values in the deployment specification.
   - Further development of the deployment status model to include more detailed states as required during implementation.
   - Evaluate the need for more specific resource values in the device capabilities section.
   - Continue collaboration with Patrick to refine the orchestration engine, ensuring it can generate accurate deployment manifests for Kubernetes and other systems.
