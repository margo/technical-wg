### Summary Meeting notes 
The meeting focused on defining the roles and responsibilities of the orchestrator within the Margot framework. Key points included the necessity of clear definitions to prevent confusion, particularly distinguishing between a Kubernetes master and a Margot orchestrator. The discussion emphasized the importance of fleet management, device onboarding, and workload orchestration. The team debated whether the orchestrator should ingest Helm charts or if local devices should manage them. They agreed on the need for updated documentation to clarify these roles and responsibilities, ensuring alignment with the project's goals and preventing misinterpretation.

### Meeting Notes
**Discussion on Technical Ad Hoc Meeting Objectives** -
Armand introduces the meeting as the second to last before the year break, with a summary session planned for the larger group next week.
The main topics are the "get alternatives" proposal and the discussion on rendering in the cloud versus rendering at the edge, specifically with Helm.
Armand mentions Josh's input on the current gitops and Kubernetes paradigm, prompting workflows about Helm chart ingestion and Kubernetes-ready files.
Phil raises concerns, suggesting a detailed review of each point to ensure everyone is aligned.

**Defining the Role of an Orchestrator** -
Group proposes a discussion on what they each think an orchestrator should do, emphasizing the need for a clear foundation.
Armand and others list responsibilities such as device onboarding, workload agent onboarding, fleet management, and app deployment.
The group agrees on the importance of clearly defining these roles, with Merrill adding fleet management and Phil mentioning health metrics and diagnosis.
Tom Counihan suggests provisioning and lifecycle management of the host operating system, and Speaker 2 adds device capability and inventory management.

**Clarifying the Scope of Orchestrator Responsibilities** -
Speaker 2 emphasizes the need to differentiate between what is in scope and out of scope for the orchestrator, suggesting a wish list for future versions.
Armand and others discuss the importance of having a clear roadmap for future versions to align organizational goals.
The group acknowledges the need for a North Star to guide their development, with Speaker 4 highlighting the importance of deep integrations.
Speaker 2 outlines the next steps: deciding if the issues are relevant to Margot and defining meaningful features for the v1 and v2 releases.

**Debate on Orchestrator vs. Workload Orchestration** -
Armand and others discuss the distinction between an orchestrator and a workload orchestration agent, emphasizing the need for fleet management.
The group debated the definition of an orchestrator, with Tom suggesting it should manage against itself and multiple nodes.
Erik emphasizes the need for interoperability and a clear API definition, suggesting the scope should focus on this rather than extensive features.
The group agrees that defining clear roles and responsibilities for each layer in the architecture is important to avoid confusion.

**Defining the Workload Orchestration Service (WOS)** -
Armand and others discuss the role of the WOS in managing multiple device types and ensuring interoperability.
Erik emphasizes the need for a clear API definition between the WOS and the workload orchestration agent, focusing on deployment and management.
The group agrees on the importance of defining the roles and responsibilities of each layer, with Phil suggesting the need for clear documentation.
Armand and others discuss the importance of ensuring the WOS can manage Kubernetes and non-Kubernetes devices, emphasizing the need for a flexible approach.

**Clarifying the Role of the Kubernetes Master** -
Erik and others discuss the role of the Kubernetes master in the context of Margot, emphasizing the need for a clear separation of responsibilities.
The group agrees that clear documentation is essential for defining the roles and responsibilities of the Kubernetes master and the WOS.
Armand and others discuss the importance of ensuring the WOS can manage Kubernetes and non-Kubernetes devices, emphasizing the need for a flexible approach.
