### Summary Meeting Notes

The meeting focused on finalizing the scope and decisions for the Margo preview release. Key points included the debate between REST API and open GitOps for providing the desired state-to-edge devices, with a consensus leaning towards REST. The team discussed the ingestion of Helm charts, considering the impact on air-gapped environments and the need for flexibility. Defining the initial release before engaging contractors was emphasized, ensuring clarity on Docker and Helm support. Other topics included avoiding external registry access, clarifying deployment status, and finalizing device capability specifications. The goal is to have these issues resolved before the 2025 kickoff.

### Minutes

**Discussion on REST API vs. Open GitOps** -
Armand highlights the main topic of the meeting: deciding between REST API and Open GitOps to provide the desired state to edge devices.
