### Meeting Summary
The meeting focused on deciding between using GitOps or REST API to deploy applications within Margo. Armand presented the current deployment process, highlighting the need to store and retrieve deployment specifications. The team discussed the pros and cons of each approach, including auditability, resource utilization, and implementation complexity. Key points included the need for versioning, rollback capabilities, and the potential impact on constrained devices. The group agreed to develop user stories and scenarios to evaluate both methods, with a follow-up meeting planned to finalize the decision based on these evaluations.

### MoM
**Overview of Deployment Process in Margo**
Armand is providing an update on how applications are currently being deployed within Margo. 
The process includes end users logging into the orchestration software and choosing from the available applications. 
A deployment specification is then created, which includes customizable options and links to Helm chart credentials. 
The discussion covers the storage and retrieval of the deployment specification, presenting two options: using a REST API or a Git backend.

**Discussion on Deployment Specification Storage**
Armand explains the two options for storing the deployment specification: using a REST API or Git backend.
Tom Counihan asks for clarification on the app repo configuration per device.
Christian raises a concern about configuring applications that require additional drivers on the host.
Erik suggests that dependencies should be included within the Helm chart to avoid preparing the node beforehand.

**Pros and Cons of REST API vs. GitOps**
Armand presents a list of pros and cons for using REST API versus GitOps for deployment specification storage.
Pros of REST include flexibility and a single interface for posting and pulling from the device to the WAS.
Cons of REST include the need to build and support the functionality natively available in GitOps.
Erik and others discuss the efficiency and resource implications of using REST versus GitOps.

**Implementation Considerations and Resource Concerns**
Erik and others discuss the resource implications of using GitOps versus REST, particularly for constrained devices.
The conversation discusses the potential benefits of having a local set of desired states for rollback or failure recovery.
Christian and Erik discuss the importance of storing the current configuration on the box for rollback scenarios.
The group considers the need for auditability and the potential impact on the WAS and device infrastructure.

**Scenario Evaluation and Next Steps**
The group discusses the need to evaluate specific scenarios to determine the best approach for deployment specification storage.
Armand suggests creating user stories to outline different deployment scenarios and evaluate the pros and cons of each approach.
Erik offers a sketch of a minimalist RESTful approach to deployment specification storage.
The group agrees to review the scenarios and implementation details in the next meeting to make a decision.

**Action Items**
- [ ] Armand to produce a set of user scenarios and a requirements document outlining the desired functionality
- [ ] Erik to provide a sample REST API implementation to demonstrate a minimalist approach and how it could meet the group's needs.
- [ ] The group to review the scenarios and requirements document and provide feedback.
