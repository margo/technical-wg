### Minutes
The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings. The topics covered included: 

* Deployment Spec and Review:
   - Armand Craig highlighted the need for one more review on the deployment spec pull request. Arne Bröring agreed to review the changes.
   - Discussion about the overlap with device management and feedback from docker is still pending.
* Workload Orchestration Agent (WOA) Communication Methods:
   - Armand proposed using a REST API for workload orchestration agent operations.
   - Consensus on using REST API for onboarding, device capabilities reporting, and deployment status updates.
* Utilization of Symphony API:
   - Consideration of using Symphony’s REST API for Margo, particularly the targets API.
   - Discussion on the implications and potential dependencies introduced by adopting Symphony’s API.
* Security and Trust Establishment:
   - Discussion on secure methods for trust establishment between endpoints, including certificates and tokens.
   - Suggestions to consider RFC standards such as EST (RFC 7030) and BRSKI (RFC 8995) for certificate and trust management.
* Device Capabilities and Management:
   - Need to define the content and format of device capabilities and how it will be reported.
   - Emphasis on leveraging existing standards and avoiding reinvention.
* Interoperability and Flexibility:
   - Discussion on the balance between providing a standardized method for Greenfield deployments and allowing flexibility for Brownfield deployments.
   - Agreement on the need for a minimal set of standardized requirements to ensure interoperability while accommodating existing solutions.

**Open Items:**
   - Arne Bröring to review the deployment spec pull request.
   - Armand Craig to work on an open API spec document for the proposed REST API functions.
   - Armand Craig to investigate EST and BRSKI RFC standards for establishing trust and secure communication.
   - Attendees to provide feedback on the issues related to deployment status and device capabilities in the spec repository.
   - Julien Duquesnay to create sequence diagrams to visualize the onboarding and communication steps for the workload orchestration agent.
   - Armand Craig to look into FIDO device onboarding and its applicability to the workload orchestration agent.
