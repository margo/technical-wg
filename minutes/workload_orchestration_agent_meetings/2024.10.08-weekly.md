### Meeting Summary
The meeting focused on user stories for deploying and maintaining workloads, emphasizing the need for interoperability. Key points included the deployment and removal of applications, reconfiguration of resources, and monitoring deployment and runtime status. The team discussed the use of GitOps for tracking configuration changes and the importance of unique IDs and versioning. Concerns were raised about the feasibility of using OpenTelemetry for runtime status and the need for clear communication paths between devices and the orchestration software. The discussion also touched on disaster recovery and the responsibilities of devices and the orchestration software in maintaining desired states.

### Minutes

**User Stories and Agenda Overview**
Armand welcomes everyone and acknowledges the ongoing discussions and work between meetings.
Armand mentions his busy schedule with an automation fair demonstration and steps back from Margo-related tasks.
The agenda includes discussing user stories related to deployment and maintenance of workloads.
Armand highlights issue number 22 about the workload management interface and mentions a broken link that needs fixing.
Armand notes concerns raised by Microsoft about using GitOps at scale for heterogeneous edge environments.

**User Stories Discussion**
Armand outlines the top two user stories: deploying one to many applications to Margo-compliant devices and deleting or removing one to many apps.
The next user story involves reconfiguring resources for an app, such as replication settings or parameter changes.
Monitoring is discussed, including reporting the current state of the desired state and runtime status post-install.
Armand emphasizes the importance of tracking configuration changes and the benefits of using GitOps for auditability.

**Runtime Status and Monitoring**
Phil raises concerns about the runtime status post-install and whether an API or GitOps could serve the same purpose.
Armand suggests that runtime status might involve OpenTelemetry, while deployment status is more static.
Julien distinguishes between deployment status (type of things) and runtime status (less frequent post-install updates).
Tom Counihan and Julien discuss the implications of using OpenTelemetry versus an API for runtime status reporting.

**API vs. OpenTelemetry for Runtime Status**
Julien and Phil discuss the need for a path through a firewall for OpenTelemetry to work effectively.
Tom Counihan suggests that the most efficient path might be east-west to an observability platform.
Armand summarizes the discussion, noting that deployment status is part of the API, but runtime status is more complex.
Phil and Julien agree that the bare minimum for the API should include deployment status and runtime status changes.

> How can we ensure effective communication between the device and the WAS for runtime status updates?
> 1. Define a clear API or protocol for the device to report runtime status changes to the WAS. This could include standardized error codes, status messages, and other relevant information.
> 2. Determine whether to use a push-based approach, where the device proactively sends updates to the WAS, or a pull-based approach, where the WAS periodically requests status updates from the device.
> 3. Consider the implications of firewalls and network segmentation, and ensure there is a secure communication channel established between the device and the WAS.
> 4. Explore the use of events or notifications to trigger status updates, rather than relying solely on periodic polling, to improve responsiveness and reduce unnecessary network traffic.
> 5. Discuss the level of detail and frequency of runtime status updates required by the WAS, and ensure the device can provide the necessary information without overburdening the system.
> The key is to establish a reliable and efficient communication mechanism that allows the device to report relevant runtime status changes to the WAS in a secure and scalable manner.

**Health Checks and Application-Specific Semantics**
Liam suggests that health checks are a common design pattern in various orchestration systems, including Kubernetes and ECS.
Armand and Merrill discuss the challenges of replicating health check functionality across different runtime environments.
Julien emphasizes the need for a communication path between the device and the WAS for status updates.
Phil and Julien discuss the importance of unique IDs and versioning for configuration management.

**Device and Workload Responsibilities**
Armand and Julien discuss the responsibilities of the device and the WAS in maintaining orchestration agent services.
Julien suggests that device management aspects might require full firmware updates.
Armand and Julien agree to identify runtime configurations and determine whether they fall under the WAS or device orchestration.
The discussion highlights the need for clear communication and management of deployment versions and states.

**Disaster Recovery and Device Behavior**
Armand and Julien discuss the expected behavior of a Margo device in various failure scenarios.
Julien suggests that Margo should specify standard behavior for devices in different types of failures.
The discussion includes the need for configurable behavior and the potential for WAS involvement in disaster recovery.
Armand and Julien agree to detail out expectations for device behavior in first boot and subsequent reboots.

> Here are some suggestions on how to define standard device behaviour:
> 1. First Boot Scenario:
>   - If the device has never received a desired state configuration, define the expected behavior, such as the device entering a known default state or awaiting instructions from the WAS.
> 2. Reboot/Reconnect Scenario:
>   - If the device has received a desired state configuration and then reboots or loses connection, define the expected behavior, such as the device attempting to restore the last known desired state configuration.
>   - Determine if the device should automatically retry applying the desired state or wait for instructions from the WAS.
> 3. Partial Failure Scenario:
>   - If only a subset of the desired state configuration has been applied on the device, define the expected behavior, such as the device maintaining the successfully applied components and reporting the failure to the WAS.
> 4. Configuration Mismatch Scenario:
>   - If the device detects a mismatch between the desired state and the current state, define the expected behavior, such as the device attempting to reconcile the differences or reporting the mismatch to the WAS.
> The key is to establish clear, standardized behaviors that the device can follow in different failure scenarios, ensuring consistent and predictable recovery without delving into the complexities of full disaster recovery mechanisms.
> This approach allows Margo to define the expected device behavior, while leaving the implementation details and any additional disaster recovery features to the device vendors and system integrators.

**Next Steps and Closing Remarks**
Armand plans to create an issue to continue the discussion on runtime status and other topics.
The team agrees to focus on defining clear communication paths and expectations for device and WAS interactions.
Armand mentions the need to finalize notes and continue discussions within the issue.
The meeting concludes with a plan to reconvene and address the remaining topics in the next call.
