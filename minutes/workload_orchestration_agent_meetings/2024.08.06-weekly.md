### Minutes
The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings. The topics covered included: 

* *Device Onboarding:
   - Discussion on the delineation between device onboarding and workload onboarding.
   - Importance of supporting multiple API endpoints per vendor for development and testing.
   - Clarification that a device typically uses a single endpoint and has specific authorization mechanisms.

* Device Capability Reporting:
   - Devices should report their current capabilities during the onboarding process.
   - Essential information includes CPU and memory resources, enabled runtimes (e.g., Python, Node.js), security standards, connectivity options, update intervals, and domain information.

* Workload Deployment Process:
   - Devices pull deployment specifications from the WAS (Workload Automation System) config repository.
   - Utilization of Helm for package deployment.
   - The device's state is updated in the WAS database post-deployment.

* Internal vs. External Registries:
   - Proposal to support only internal registries for deployments to enhance security.
   - Erik Nordmark emphasized the benefits of using public registries with proper authentication, authorization, and signature verification.
   - Andreas Häckel noted the potential need for internal registries due to the lack of signature support for certain package types (e.g., Helm charts).

* Next Steps and Feedback:
   - Amir Varastehhajipour will review and provide feedback on the current documentation.
   - Andreas Häckel's proposal on internal registries will be discussed further in the next App Distribution meeting.

**Open Items:**

   - Armand Craig to further document the need for supporting multiple API endpoints.
   - Erik Nordmark to clarify the use of single endpoints and authorization mechanisms.
   - Team to ensure all necessary device capability information is included in the onboarding process.
   - Further refine the deployment process details, especially regarding Helm usage and state updates.
   - Discuss Andreas' proposal in the upcoming App Distribution meeting.
   - Evaluate the feasibility and implications of supporting only internal registries for enhanced security.
