### Minutes
The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings. The topics covered included: 

* Procedural Improvement: Timeboxing Feedback:
   - A proposal was made to establish deadlines for feedback on major decisions to ensure timely progression. Feedback on the Rest API and GitOps approach should be submitted by September 10.

* Discussion on the Workload Management Interface and Rest API
   - Proposal for Rest API Interface:
     - The team discussed the proposed use of a Rest API originating from the edge as a client to the server hosted by the WAZ (Workload Orchestration Software).
     - Main functions include:
       - Onboarding mechanism to inform the WAZ of device capabilities.
       - Reporting the status of workload deployments.
       - Building a scalable API for future functionality.
     - Approval for this API approach was already received from ABB, Siemens, and Cap Gemini.

* Discussion on GitOps Approach
   - Proposal for using GitOps:
     - Suggested approach involves the edge device using a Git pull to fetch the desired state (YAML file) from the WAZ-managed Git repository.
     - Discussion on alternative options: Christian Storm proposed allowing flexibility in the API by abstracting it, enabling alternatives such as Curl instead of Git for retrieving the deployment specification.
     - Concerns raised:
       - Philip Presson emphasized the importance of using standardized APIs to prevent conflicts and maintain interoperability.
       - The need for standardizing the GitOps API, instead of relying solely on implementations like GitHub’s, was discussed.

* Action Item: Clarifying GitOps Requirements
   - There was confusion around the exact definition of the GitOps API. It was agreed that further clarification is needed to ensure compatibility and flexibility across different systems (Git, Curl, or other mechanisms).
   - Armand will work with the technical group to define a clear subset of Git functionalities that will be used as the standard interface.

* App Configuration and Large Artifacts Handling
   - The group discussed how apps deployed via the workload orchestration system should handle large files, such as machine learning models, outside the deployment YAML.
   - A debate arose on whether the WAZ should host such large volumes or if it should rely on external mechanisms for app-specific configurations and artifacts.

**Open Items**
* Rest API Feedback (All): Provide feedback on the Rest API decision by September 10.
* GitOps Clarification: Define a clearer specification for the GitOps approach, ensuring flexibility for custom implementations.
* Artifact Management Proposal: Investigate options for app configuration and large artifact management within the Margo system.
