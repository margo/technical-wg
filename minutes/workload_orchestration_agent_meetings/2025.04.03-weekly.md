### Summary Meeting Notes
The meeting centred on developing Margo, a system for managing edge devices and workloads. Key discussions included the finalisation of Avasa Carl's proposal, the need for improved reference architectures, and the importance of device capabilities for workload matching. The team acknowledged challenges in managing multi-node clusters and emphasised the necessity for standardised labels and key-value pairs. They agreed to refine the specification using customer use cases and prioritised features for the initial Margo release.

### Minutes

**Vision Slides and Feature Approval**
Armand updates the group on the Woah interfaces project, emphasising the need for better descriptions of device capabilities. He discusses the vision slides that drive the parent and child ethics, linking them to features for the external team. Additionally, he mentions an approved requirement for prototypes to test four API options.

**Device Capabilities and Workload Management**
Armand expresses concern about devices opting out of management via Margo, which affects workload management. He and Christian Storm discuss a tiered approach, highlighting the need for APIs to facilitate information transfer between devices and Margo. Armand proposes a Tier One approach, informing the fleet manager about device capabilities and enabling changes via a proprietary tool.

**Fleet Manager and Cluster Management**
Armand expresses concern about devices opting out of management via Margo, which affects workload management. He and Christian Storm discuss a tiered approach, highlighting the need for APIs to facilitate information transfer between devices and Margo. Armand proposes a Tier One approach, informing the fleet manager about device capabilities and enabling changes via a proprietary tool.

**Networking and Labeling**
Erik highlights the need for a clear demarcation between device capabilities and workload requirements, using labels and strings to describe network interfaces. Armand stresses the importance of providing a detailed description of device capabilities to align with application requirements. Phil and Erik discuss Kubernetes' limitations in this area, advocating for a more flexible approach. A member shares examples of applications operating across multiple networks, emphasising the necessity for a generic model to describe resource capabilities.

**Multi-Node Clusters and Fleet Management**
Erik talks about the challenges of managing multi-node clusters and the fleet manager's role in Kubernetes. Armand shares the Red Hat solution, which ingests Helm charts to create deployment specs tied to specific resources. Erik and Speaker 3 highlight the importance of maintaining abstraction layers and the local orchestrator's role in workload management. Armand stresses that the fleet manager must define the state and ensure workloads are deployed correctly.

**Customer Perspective and Specification Development**
Karthik suggests using example personas and customer use cases to pinpoint challenges and commonalities in solution development and deployment. Armand agrees, noting the need to better document the problem to prepare for the next call on key value pairs and application requirements. Erik highlights the importance of understanding the customer's perspective and adopting a structured approach to specification development. Armand commits to developing a more robust example and sharing it with the group for further discussion!

**Final Thoughts and Next Steps**
Armand highlights the importance of collaborating with the steering committee to prioritise the release of Margo and the implications for device management options. The group suggests finding a balance between abstract resource representation and specific device capabilities. Armand notes the need to continue discussions on the app package project, emphasising the user's perspective. The meeting wraps up with Armand planning to follow up with the group and continue the conversation in the next call!

### Action Items
- [ ] Armand to work on a more robust example scenario involving multiple sites and device types to help drive the discussion on device capabilities and requirements mapping.
- [ ] Armand to discuss with the steering committee the priorities for Margo release 1, particularly around the decision on enabling device management versus the "opt-out" approach.
