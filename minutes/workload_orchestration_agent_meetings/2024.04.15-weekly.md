Armand opens the meeting at 15:00 BST

### Summary Meeting Notes
The meeting addressed integrating Fido's zero-trust onboarding solution (FTO) into Margo's workload management interface. FTO involves creating a base key and certificate in devices, along with an ownership voucher for secure onboarding. The process includes a rendezvous server for device-cloud communication and Fido Service Information Modules (FSIMs) for onboarding operations. The discussion highlighted FTO's flexibility across various operating systems and networks, as well as its potential for retrofitting legacy devices. The next meeting will further explore the supply chain and ownership voucher aspects.

### Action Items
- [ ] Discuss further the use of FDO mechanisms, such as the ownership voucher and rendezvous server, and how they could be adopted or adapted for the Margo context.
- [ ] Schedule Fido's next presentation to explore the specific questions and concerns raised by the Margo community.
- [ ] Explore mapping the FDO/Fido solution onto a realistic networking environment with L2/L3 hops, to understand how the different components would be placed.

### Minutes

**Overview of the Meeting's Purpose**
Armand outlines the meeting's purpose, focusing on a memorandum of understanding between Fido and Margo. The discussion will centre on a solution for workload management presented by Richard and Jeff from Fido. It will cover device onboarding and the management interface for workloads, supported by a brief overview of vision slides that set technical requirements.

**Fido's Role and Introduction**
Richard introduces himself and Jeff Cooper from Fido, mentioning their prior experience with Intel. Richard explains the conversation's focus on phase one of the onboarding of the workload fleet management agent (WLFA). The goal is to establish a zero-trust delivery of credentials to the WLFA. Richard provides an overview of the Fido Alliance, its mission, and its members, including Red Hat, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon.

**Fido's Onboarding Process**
The onboarding process begins with the device manufacturer placing a base key in the device. This base key contains a certificate that provides fundamental information about the device. Additionally, the manufacturer supplies a certificate defined by public keys or certificates. The device then uses a rendezvous server to locate the target cloud, establishing a secure channel for data transfer.

**Details of the Onboarding Process**
Richard outlines the rendezvous server's function in linking the device to the target cloud. This connection establishes mutual authentication and a secure data transfer channel, facilitating commands, file downloads, command execution, and certificate signing. He also introduces Fido Service Information Modules (FSIMs), which define specific onboarding operations.

**Challenges and Solutions for Legacy Devices**
Armand expresses concerns regarding the onboarding of legacy devices lacking FIDO credentials. Richard proposes leveraging existing mechanisms to install Fido on these devices, discussing using USB sticks or alternative methods for bootstrapping. Armand highlights the importance of a standardised onboarding process for new and legacy devices within Margo.

**Fido's Flexibility and Compatibility**
Richard emphasises Fido's flexibility and compatibility with various operating systems, hardware, and network types. Fido operates on microcontrollers and supports both on-premise and off-premise deployments. Armand reiterates the objective of creating a reference implementation for vendors to adopt or develop their solutions.

**Future Directions and Next Steps**
Richard mentioned the potential of using Fido for various capabilities in the future, including software deployment and embedding Fido within the BIOS. Armand discussed how Fido could enable unique features in Margo. The upcoming presentation will address specific questions from the Margo team, and Armand encourages the community to share reference architectures and networking setups on GitHub.

**Closing Remarks and Next Meeting**
Armand thanked Richard and Jeff for their presentation and confirmed the next meeting for Thursday. The community is encouraged to ask questions and provide feedback to refine the onboarding process. The meeting concluded with a reminder of the importance of standardising onboarding for interoperability and vendor adoption.
