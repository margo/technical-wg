### Meeting Summary Notes
The meeting focused on the workload management interface, discussing security access to private registries and authentication methods. The team debated between using REST or GitOps for deployment spec retrieval, with a consensus leaning towards REST for its simplicity and flexibility. They also considered the flexibility for fleet managers to store desired states in various repositories, including OCI registries. Concerns about the technical feasibility and conformance testing of GitOps were raised. The team agreed to abstract the storage method and proposed a REST API to retrieve desired states, ensuring secure transport and flexibility in deployment spec management.

### Minutes of Meeting
**Workload Management Interface Overview**
Armand welcomes everyone and outlines the agenda, stressing the significance of the workload management interface and key challenges. He highlights the need to discuss security access to private registries and authentication methods. Additionally, Armand prompts the team to reconsider the conversation on GET operations compared to REST for obtaining deployment specifications. He also invites adding more topics to the agenda and encourages participants to share their thoughts.

**Security Access and Authentication Discussion**
Armand addresses the necessity for secure access to private registries and how the platform facilitates this. He highlights the importance of incorporating access tokens in the deployment specifications, enabling the Edge platform to access workloads. Phil and James discuss the significance of securely delivering credentials and the adaptability required for various environments. Additionally, Armand stresses the importance of enhancing the deployment specifications to integrate access tokens for Helm and OCI containers.

**Deployment Spec and REST vs GET Ops**
Armand returns to the deployment specification's decision tracker, observing the agreement to avoid open GET operations. He suggests holding a vote to endorse REST for retrieving the deployment specifications. James and Silvano talk about the advantages of utilizing REST with GitOps, highlighting the potential of a lightweight REST client. Armand emphasizes the requirement for a straightforward REST API to obtain the desired state, independent from the storage approach utilized by the fleet manager.

**REST API Proposals and Implementation**
Armand and Phil examine various proposals for REST API endpoints designed to fetch the desired state. Armand shares these proposals in the chat for feedback and assessment. Silvano suggests using OCI registries to hold the desired state, highlighting the benefits of using established solutions. Meanwhile, Armand and Merrill discuss the importance of creating a simple REST API that conceals the storage technique employed by the fleet manager.

**Fleet Manager Flexibility and Helm Chart Ingestion**
Armand and James discuss the fleet manager's need to either ingest Helm charts or handle them locally on the device. Deepak expresses worries regarding the requirement for custom data from the application provider, which may be absent in the Helm chart. They agree on enabling the fleet manager to ingest Helm charts when needed. Due to time limitations, Armand intends to postpone the discussion to a later meeting.

**Next Steps and Action Items**
Armand outlines the agreement on utilizing REST for deployment specification retrieval and emphasizes the importance of a versatile REST API. He intends to solicit community feedback through voting on the new proposal and will arrange subsequent meetings for more in-depth discussions. In a conversation with Merrill, they highlight the necessity for a reference implementation to showcase the REST API's features. Armand concludes the meeting by expressing gratitude to all attendees and detailing the upcoming steps for follow-up discussions.

### Action Items
- [ ] All - Clarify the allowed/mandatory options for the desired state specification.
- [ ] All - Reach out to Arne to discuss possibly leaving out app device requirements from preview release one.
- [ ] Implement the device-side functionality for deploying the deployment spec.
- [ ] Work with Phil to implement the REST API for communication between the workload orchestration solution and the device.
- [ ] Schedule time for Sega to present the device-side implementation next week.
