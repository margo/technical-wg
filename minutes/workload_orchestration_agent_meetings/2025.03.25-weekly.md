**Armand opens the meeting at 14:00 GMT**

### Summary Meeting Notes
The meeting centred on developing and standardising the Margo specification for interoperability in industrial automation. Key points included establishing a bi-directional data channel for offline scenarios, employing MTLS and QUIC protocols, and maintaining existing features while innovating. The discussion underscored the necessity of a common testing infrastructure and evaluation criteria for comparing proposals. The team recognised the importance of involving fleet managers to ensure the specification does not impede their differentiation. Next steps involve constructing a testing environment and refining proposals for further evaluation.

### Action Items
- [ ] Develop evaluation criteria for the Margo management interface API options.
- [ ] Set up a standard testing infrastructure to assess the various API proposals.
- [ ] Flesh out the details of the API proposals that are not yet fully fleshed out.
- [ ] Coordinate with the external development team to build prototypes of the API options for testing.
- [ ] Ensure the involvement of fleet manager representatives (e.g., SUSE, Microsoft, Red Hat) in the decision-making process.

### Minutes
**Discussion on Symphony's Campaign Management and AI Tool**
Armand welcomes everyone and notes the lighter attendance. He mentions Hashi's absence and discusses Symphony's state-seeking campaigns like Canary and slow rollouts. Armand highlights the ongoing debate on whether campaigns should adopt a push or pull model but skips the topic of Symphony's AI tool due to Hashi's absence.

**Presentation on Desired State and Configuration**
Armand encourages Carl Moberg to present the desired state and configuration based on feedback. Moberg highlights the significance of effective communication from the agent side, utilising established protocols. He also addresses the trade-offs between real-time responsiveness, operational granularity, and bandwidth needs while stressing the necessity of considering offline scenarios amid potential push model conflicts.

**Architecture Options and Layer 2 vs. Layer 3 Access**
Armand inquires about the placement of components in the architecture, specifically at layer 2 or layer 3. Carl Moberg outlines two options: direct access from layer 2 to the cloud fleet manager or using layer 3. He emphasises the operational security culture, discussing the rationale for allowing layer 2 devices to communicate directly with the unsafe zone and recommends a balanced approach using MTLS for quick scaling and QUIC for enhanced scaling properties.

**Bi-Directional Data and Multi-Tenancy**
Carl Moberg highlights the need for bidirectional data to manage offline scenarios and buffer data. This approach simplifies remediation upon reconnection. He also emphasises the significance of multi-tenancy, which allows for the separation of traffic from different tenants using distinct keying material. He mentions additional features like terminal access and virtual machines supported by a bidirectional channel model.

**Discussion on MTLS Concerns and Proposed Solutions**
Armand and Carl Moberg address Eric's concerns regarding MTLS, emphasising the necessity of adhering to established techniques. Carl notes that most issues have been resolved, with AWS offering configurable mainstream features to mitigate them. He advocates for testing and comparing proposed solutions to ensure they meet community needs.

**Exploration of Multiple Proposals and Interoperability**
Armand emphasises the need to explore multiple proposals for interoperability and to avoid dependence on external feedback. He suggests engaging an external team to develop various options for testing and comparison. Additionally, he highlights the importance of a common infrastructure and establishing evaluation criteria to make informed decisions.

**Challenges of Standardizing on a Single Option**
Phil expresses concerns that multiple task methods could hinder vendor adoption of Margo. Armand and Carl Moberg highlight the need to balance innovation with interoperability, ensuring platform capabilities remain intact. Armand underscores the importance of simplifying the adoption process for app developers, device manufacturers, and fleet managers, with the ultimate goal of fostering interoperability among vendors for end users.

**Evaluation Criteria and Testing Environment**
Armand and Carl Moberg discuss establishing evaluation criteria for comparing various options. Armand proposes using an external team to create a common testing environment and stresses the importance of a unified infrastructure. He also highlights the necessity of elaborateing on the proposals and addressing any detail gaps.

**Decision-Making Process and Steering Committee Involvement**
Bart highlights the necessity of involving the steering committee in decision-making. He suggests that the technical working group should ultimately decide based on a criteria-based analysis. Additionally, Armand stresses the importance of including the external team in testing and evaluation and taking the necessary time to ensure sound decisions are made.

**Next Steps and Closing Remarks**
Armand outlines the next steps, emphasising the importance of involving the external team and the technical working group. He highlights the need for careful decision-making and closes the meeting by reiterating the necessity for continued collaboration and communication.
