Armand Craig shared information about the general project board setups, as well as a blog he had written to generate excitement for the Github repository.
The discussion broadly covered:

* **Blueprint Strategy:**
How blueprints are used in Margo's specification development workflow, in order to gather feedback and input. There was a discussion about the role and implementation of a forthcoming blueprint from Symphony, and how it ties into current project specifications.

* **Deployment Specification:**
Armand highlighted the need for a deployment specification, mentioning that it is still under investigation and not yet fully defined in their documents. The conversation also touched upon how to approach the creation of deployment specs, potentially starting with a proposal that could later be integrated into official specifications.

* **GitOps / API Integration:**
A substantial portion of the discussion revolved around which approach to take with Margo - GitOps or an API service. This included weighing the pros and cons of each method, with considerations on auditable history and internal mechanisms for handling deployments.
