**Armand opens the meeting at 15:00 GMT**

### Summary Meeting notes
The workload orchestration and agent focus group discussed the lack of feedback on the wool interface proposals. Armand noted that only ABB's feedback was received and emphasized the need for consolidated input to progress. Merrill mentioned upcoming meetings with Schneider to provide feedback and proposed proof of concept work. Erik and Armand agreed to set a soft feedback deadline by next Monday to facilitate discussion. Armand will follow up with a reminder email, urging participants to provide detailed feedback in the repository. The group stressed the importance of vendor engagement, especially from fleet managers, to ensure comprehensive feedback and informed decision-making.

**Email Communication and Proposal Feedback**
Armand asked whether participants had received his email about the wool interfaces proposals. Erik stated that he received a generic email but did not remember the title. Grant and the other members confirmed that they had not received the email, and Armand offered to add Grant to the technical working group list.

**Discussion on Proposal Feedback and Process Improvement**
Armand emphasises the significance of feedback regarding the management interface proposals to facilitate progress. Merrill states that he will meet with Schneider to offer input and suggests undertaking proof of concept work. Grant notes that a group within his organisation is tasked with reviewing the proposals, but he needs to address communication issues. Armand reassures Grant and ensures he is included on the distribution list.

**Feedback Collection and Deadlines**
Armand highlights the importance of consolidated feedback in advancing within the focus group. Merrill and Erik acknowledge the need for deadlines to collect input and facilitate progress. Armand is contemplating sending a reminder email with a gentle deadline next Monday to review the feedback. Erik proposes that feedback be explicitly requested from internal teams to guarantee responses.

**Clarifying Feedback Process and Repository Instructions**
Armand details how to give feedback via the repository, which involves creating a new markdown file. Erik and another participant emphasize the necessity of comprehensive feedback on all proposals. Armand reiterates the feedback instructions and expresses gratitude to everyone for their contributions. The meeting wraps up with Armand intending to revise the email and request feedback by the following week.
