Armand Craig welcomed participants and explained that focus groups are sub-groups of the Techncial Working Group. This focus group is concerned with the workload orchestration agent and interfaces. Armand encouraged members to volunteer or consider leading other focus groups for Margo, noting other areas that have not been tackled as yet.

Craig reviewed the functionalities and ongoing development issues related to the workload orchestration agent and interfaces, which plays a crucial role in managing communication between the edge device and the orchestration software. The agent ensures the initiation of communication from the edge, handling the pulling and applying of the desired state from the orchestration layer.

The discussion broadly covered:
- The agent's design to always initiate communication to enhance security and control.
- The ongoing development of the agent enrollment process, where the agent would pass device capability information to the orchestration layer, though this aspect is still under investigation for optimal implementation strategies.
- Discussion on communication patterns between the agent and the orchestration software, with options being explored between using an API or adopting a GitOps approach. Each has its benefits and challenges, such as API management overhead versus GitOps' ease of maintaining historical states.
- The importance of minimizing the agentâ€™s footprint on devices to support a wider range of devices and ensuring the agent can run effectively in various environments.

Armand emphasized the project's commitment to being opinionated in its standards to achieve interoperability while acknowledging the need for flexibility in implementation to cater to various real-world applications and device capabilities. Next steps include soliciting feedback to refine the specifications and implementation strategies.

Jory Burson from the Linux Foundation addressed administrative points regarding meeting invitations, GitHub organization access, and CLA management. Members should email operations@margo.org for support.
