### Minutes
The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings. The topics covered included: 

* Device and Workload Orchestration:
   - The discussion primarily revolved around the orchestration of devices and workloads. It was highlighted that the device orchestration mechanism should be capable of interacting with the Margo workload orchestration system to retrieve necessary information.
   - There was a consensus that the current process needs clarity, particularly regarding the enrollment and configuration of devices and the management of device capabilities.
* Enrollment Process:
   - Multiple methods for the enrollment process were considered, including service-based enrollment, a web-based enrollment process, and pre-configured enrollment shipped with devices.
   - The need for a well-defined and flexible enrollment process was emphasized, taking into account various customer requirements and security considerations.
* Authentication and Authorization:
   - The discussion touched upon different methods of authentication and the complexity of implementing them, such as OAuth, OpenID, and SSO.
   - The importance of simplifying the authentication process while ensuring security was highlighted. A suggestion was made to offload heavy lifting to a proxy or host-based service to manage the authentication and configuration process.
* Interface Configuration and Communication Protocols:
   - The team debated between using REST API and gRPC for communication. It was acknowledged that while REST API is currently preferred, gRPC could be more efficient and lightweight but might face issues with proxies in industrial settings.
   - The need for a decision backed by thorough research and testing of both protocols in different environments was recognized.
* Overall Strategy and Naming Conventions:
   - The transition from using terms like "Woah" and "Doah" to more descriptive names like "Margo Device Interface" was discussed. The new terminology should clearly distinguish between device management and workload orchestration functionalities.
   - There was an agreement to focus on naming that reflects the management aspect rather than just the interface.

**Open Items**
   - Further investigation into the use of REST API vs. gRPC, including pros and cons, and impact on deployment in various industrial environments.
   - Examine and document different authentication methods, focusing on the feasibility and complexity of each within the Margo project.
   - Define a detailed and flexible enrollment process that can accommodate different customer scenarios, including service-based, web-based, and pre-configured methods.
   - Clarify the relationship and sequence between overall deployment state and individual component states in the deployment status reporting.
   - Develop a proxy or host-based service concept to manage the authentication and configuration process, offloading the complexity from the device interface.
   - Create prototypes and conduct testing for the proposed solutions to validate their effectiveness and interoperability.
   - Update the document to reflect the agreed-upon naming conventions and ensure clarity in distinguishing device management from workload orchestration.
   - Consolidate discussions into a single comprehensive document to streamline the decision-making process and provide a clear reference for the development team.
   - Share findings and proposed solutions with the broader community for feedback and further refinement.
   - Engage with customers and stakeholders to ensure the proposed processes meet their needs and expectations.
