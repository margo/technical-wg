### Minutes
The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings. The topics covered included: 

* Terminology Update:

* Administrative Updates:
- A PSA was issued for those needing access to Discord boards. Reach out if access is needed.
- Julian successfully gained access to the working group’s discussion forum

* Specification Repository Updates
- Armand has cleaned up the issues within the specification repository and linked them to a large pull request (PR 919). Issues were renamed to "decision trackers" to better align with the current workflow.
- Action Item: Jory is finalizing the list of approvers for decision reviews, with ongoing efforts to gather necessary GitHub IDs from various representatives.
  
* Approval Process and Timeline
- The goal is to timebox the decision-tracking process to ensure timely reviews and feedback from all vendors.
- Decision trackers include key topics:
  1. Open GitOps usage for desired state/deployment specifications.
  2. REST API for functions like onboarding, device capability information, and workload deployment status updates.

* Reference Implementation Work
- Armand aims to begin work on reference implementations once approvers finalize their feedback.
  
* Technical Discussions
- A discussion on the importance of locally rendering the documentation (using MkDocs) for contributors was raised. Instructions will be created and added to the repository.
- The pull request details secure transport implementation for REST APIs, addressing how to manage cloud scaling and man-in-the-middle attacks using X.509 certificates and signed messages.
- Approvers are expected to give feedback by **September 10th**.

**Open Items:**
- Jory to finalize the list of approvers and gather missing GitHub IDs.
- Armand to update the repository with local rendering instructions.
- All participants to review the pull request and decision trackers by September 10th.
