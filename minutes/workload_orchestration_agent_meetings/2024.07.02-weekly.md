### Minutes
The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings. The topics covered included: 

* Pull Request Review:
   - Armand Craig mentioned the pull request for quick edits to the workload orchestration agent Markdown.
   - The deployment spec now matches the app package, aligning attributes like the application ID.
   - Action: Armand requested an additional review and approval of the pull request to proceed with merging.
* Communication Pattern for Workload Orchestration Agent:
   - Discussion on the appropriate communication pattern for the workload orchestration agent and the fleet management tool in the cloud.
   - Two approaches were considered: GitOps approach and a Margo-specific API approach.
* Device Capabilities Reporting:
   - Discussion on whether the workload orchestration agent should inform the workload orchestration software of the device capabilities.
   - The consensus was that the agent should not use GitOps for reporting deployment status or device capabilities due to its static nature.
   - Preference for using dynamic API calls for reporting device capabilities and deployment status.
* Deployment Spec Segmentation:
   - Philip Presson suggested segmenting the deployment spec to keep common attributes unchanged while dynamically updating metadata based on device capabilities.
   - The deployment spec could be informed by up-to-date information about the device's status and capabilities.

**Open Items:**
   - One more review is needed for the pull request related to the workload orchestration agent Markdown. 
   - Team members to provide feedback on the current discussion issue about the communication pattern for the workload orchestration agent.
   - Align on the approach that device capabilities reporting and deployment status should rely on API calls instead of GitOps.
   - Further discussion needed on using API for device enrollment to the cloud, ensuring it aligns with the decided communication pattern.
