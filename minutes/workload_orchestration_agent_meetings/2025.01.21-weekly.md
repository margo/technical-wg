**Armond opens the meeting at 15:00 GMT.**

### Summary meeting notes

The meeting focused on approving and implementing REST APIs for managing device capabilities and deployment status. Armand confirmed approval to use REST APIs for retrieving the desired state, with support from Intel, Schneider, Emerson, Rockwell, Siemens, and ABB. Discussions included delineating REST APIs and OpenTelemetry (OTEL) for status updates and the potential use of OCI registries for the efficient distribution of desired state documents. Silvano and Michael presented a POC using OCI registries, highlighting its scalability and reliability. The team agreed to discuss optimization strategies and integration with Redfish in future meetings.

### Minutes
**REST API Approval and Next Steps:**
The primary agenda encompasses discussing the decision tracker for REST versus GET operations, reviewing votes, and planning the next steps after approval. Armand notes that several companies, including Intel, Schneider, Emerson, Rockwell, Siemens, and ABB, have approved the REST API functionality to retrieve the desired state. He then outlines the upcoming actions, which involve reviewing and updating the pre-draft specification to eliminate references to GET operations and replace them with terms related to REST.

**Discussion on REST API and OpenTelemetry Integration:**
Armand highlights two more concerns in the issue tracker: the explanation of the workload deployment status mechanism and the specifications for device capabilities. Erik inquires about the distinction between REST API and OpenTelemetry (OTEL). Armand clarifies the proposed approach, indicating that the REST API will manage high-level status updates, whereas OTEL will convey detailed runtime data. Merrill questions the implementation of the Redfish REST interface and its connection with OTEL.

**Evaluating Redfish and Device Capabilities:**
Armand highlights the necessity of assessing Redfish and how it integrates with the REST API. Merrill and Erik discussed Redfish's application for device capabilities and its relation to OTEL. Armand proposes that Redfish may serve for device-focused data, whereas OTEL would be responsible for orchestrating workloads. Because of network limitations, Colin Andre from Belden stresses the significance of distinguishing between northbound and southbound interfaces.

**Polling vs. Webhooks for Deployment Status:**
Erik and Christian evaluate the effectiveness of polling compared to webhooks for deployment status updates. Armand confirms that the REST API will facilitate client-to-server polling to obtain updated deployment specifications. Silvano proposes that a straightforward interface for transmitting all data should be necessary, while enhancements for sending only differences may be optional. The team concurs to postpone discussions on extra features and concentrate on implementing the fundamental REST API.

**Link ML Presentation and Verification:**
Armand references last week's Link ML presentation, which focuses on aiding the specification's testing and verification. Silvano clarifies that Link ML formalizes resources, generates documentation, and validates JSON schemas. The team discusses the potential advantages and drawbacks of employing Link ML for verification and testing purposes. Armand proposes that Link ML can contribute to maintaining consistent formatting and verification across products.

**Proposal for REST API Using OCI Registries:**
Silvano and Michael introduce a proposal utilising OCI registries to distribute desired state documents. This approach uses the current OCI infrastructure to ensure scalability, reliability, and widespread access. Michael showcases a proof of concept (POC) that uploads a desired state document to an OCI registry and retrieves it to a device for deployment. The team is contemplating the effectiveness of employing OCI registries and considering the possibility of further optimization in upcoming releases.

**Discussion on Optimization and Efficiency:**
Erik expresses concerns regarding polling efficiency and the necessity for optimization. Silvano points out that the OCI registry API lacks effective caching, yet the small size of the manifest helps reduce overhead. Colin Andre highlights the significance of efficient test cycles in development, recommending that new versions be communicated outside the OCI specification. The team agrees to explore optimization strategies in upcoming discussions while concentrating on the basic implementation for the initial release.

**Conclusion and Next Step:s**
Armand outlines the main topics addressed, including endorsing the REST API for deployment status and device capabilities. In upcoming meetings, the team consents to further discussions on optimizing and integrating Redfish and OCI registries. Armand appreciates everyoneâ€™s input and schedules the next meeting. The meeting ends with a pledge to enhance the specification and tackle outstanding issues.

### Action Items
- [ ] Review the current specification and update it to remove references to the "get ops" approach and replace it with the REST API terminology.
- [ ] Investigate and document the delineation between the information provided through the REST API versus OTEL.
- [ ] Follow up on the discussion around integrating Redfish and how it could be used alongside the REST API.
- [ ] Review the OCI registry-based proposal for distributing the desired state and discuss further at the next meeting.
