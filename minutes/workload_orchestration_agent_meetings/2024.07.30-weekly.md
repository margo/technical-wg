* FDO and Alternative Solutions:
   - Consideration of using FDO (FIDO Device Onboarding) for device onboarding and workload orchestration.
   - The need for a multi-tiered security solution that accommodates both Brownfield (existing) and Greenfield (new) devices was acknowledged.

* Focus on Brownfield Solutions:
