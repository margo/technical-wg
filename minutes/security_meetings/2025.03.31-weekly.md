Armand opens the meeting at 15:00 

### Summary meeting notes

The meeting focused on the development and implementation of security measures for Margo, an open-source project. Key points included the need for a generic threat model for Margo's components, the use of Microsoft's threat modeling tool, and the impact of the EU Cyber Resiliency Act (CRA) on Margo's compliance. The team discussed the importance of secure coding practices, multi-vendor app security, and the potential use of Intel SGX for secure enclaves. They also considered the need for a framework to handle Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) within 90 days and the potential benefits of learning from the OpenRAN Alliance's test automation framework.

### Action Items
- [ ] Investigate the Microsoft Threat Modelling Tool and its applicability to Margo.
- [ ] Reach out to the internal team that worked on the Symphony project to understand the threat modelling approach and tools they used.
- [ ] Investigate the EU Cyber Resiliency Act (CRA) and its potential impact on Margo.
- [ ] Explore the Open RAN Alliance framework for test automation around compliance, and assess its relevance for Margo.
- [ ] Expand the Margo specification to include more prescriptive requirements around the cyber security capabilities that must be present on Margo devices.
- [ ] Investigate the NIST Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) and its applicability to the Margo reference implementation.
- [ ] Discuss the challenges and potential solutions around ensuring secure isolation between multiple vendor applications running on the same Margo device.

### Meeting Mintues

**Project Kickoff and Initial Tasks**
Armand mentions the absence of Eric and outlines the meeting's agenda, focusing on tasks from the previous week.
Armand discusses the importance of security and technical debt, referencing Eric's concerns.
Armand shares a project link on GitHub for task management and mentions the need to create a generic threat model for Margo's components.
Phil raises a question about tooling for threat modeling, and Armand emphasizes the importance of having a consistent framework for threat modeling.

**Discussion on Threat Modeling Tools**
Phil mentions a Microsoft threat modeling tool he is familiar with, which helps design systems and identify threats based on system construction.
Christian Storm from Siemens highlights the need for both technical and risk assessment aspects of threat modeling.
Armand and Christian discuss the importance of having a consistent framework and tooling for threat modeling to avoid inconsistencies in outputs.
Phil provides more details about the Microsoft threat modeling tool, including its ability to identify threats based on system design and communication protocols.

**Exploring Additional Threat Modeling Tools**
Christian Storm suggests that other tools might be available, and Armand encourages the group to investigate other options.
Speaker 4 shares an experience with the Microsoft security team reviewing their design and architecture, which might provide useful insights.
Speaker 4 mentions common sense security practices, such as proper authentication and secure communication channels, as part of threat modeling.
Armand emphasizes the need for the group to gather and analyze outputs from other projects to inform their threat modeling efforts.

**Cyber Resiliency Act (CRA) and Its Impact on Margo**
Armand raises the topic of Margo's stance on the EU Cyber Resiliency Act (CRA) and its potential impact on Margo's compliance.
Christian Storm explains that Margo, as an open-source project, may have limited liability, but vendors bringing Margo to market will face compliance challenges.
Armand and Christian discuss the need for processes to handle Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) within the 90-day timeline required by CRA.
James shares insights from a Linux Foundation presentation on CRA, highlighting its implications for open-source projects and the need for strict compliance processes.

**OpenRAN Alliance and Test Automation Frameworks**
Armand mentions the OpenRAN Alliance as a potential source of lessons learned for Margo.
James suggests that the OpenRAN Alliance's test automation framework for compliance could be useful for Margo's internal adoption.
Christian Storm expresses concerns about testing black-box systems and suggests focusing on state-of-the-art software development practices.
Armand and Christian discuss the potential for Margo to provide tools for testing compliance and the need for a common infrastructure for uploading and reporting results.

**Cybersecurity Requirements for Margo Devices**
Armand discusses the need to expand the base-level requirements for devices to include cybersecurity components.
Christian Storm emphasizes the importance of mandating certain security requirements while allowing for flexibility in implementation.
Haishi suggests differentiating between devices that support attestation and those that can be attested, covering both brownfield and greenfield scenarios.
Armand and Christian discuss the balance between security requirements and the need for interoperability, considering the first and second releases of Margo.

**Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF)**
Armand introduces the topic of the NIST SSDF, a set of secure software development practices.
Christian Storm explains that SSDF focuses on secure coding guidelines and processes, rather than infrastructure security.
Armand and Christian discuss the relevance of SSDF to Margo's reference implementation and the need to follow established secure development practices.
The group considers the implications of SSDF for Margo's open-source components and the need for compliance with standards like 6443.

**Multi-Vendor App Security and Isolation**
Armand and Christian discuss the challenges of ensuring secure isolation for multi-vendor apps running on the same box.
Christian explains the limitations of containerization and the need for hardware-level security features like Intel SGX.
Phil suggests providing guidelines or requirements for deploying applications in secure namespaces and containers to limit access to sensitive information.
The group acknowledges the complexity of achieving complete isolation and the need for a balance between security and interoperability.

**Multi-Vendor App Use Cases and Security Considerations**
Karthik raises questions about the security requirements for multi-vendor apps running on the same box.
Armand and Christian discuss the importance of software isolation through namespaces and pod separation, but acknowledge the need for hardware-level security.
Karthik suggests creating a task to further explore the security requirements for multi-vendor apps and their impact on Margo's architecture.
The group agrees to continue discussing these issues and to assign tasks to ensure progress on security and compliance efforts.
