### Summary Meeting Notes

The meeting aimed to define the responsibilities and initial tasks of the Security Focus Group. Discussions centred on categorising security issues, including workload fleet management, device management, and compliance with standards like NIST and the EU Cyber Resiliency Act. Key topics included mutual TLS, OCI registries, and secure boot. The group highlighted the necessity for a threat model and compliance framework to direct security requirements. Action items involved creating issue tickets for further investigation and future presentations. The ultimate goal is to ensure Margo's specifications support cybersecurity while maintaining flexibility in implementation.

### Action Items
- [ ] Create a threat model and security architecture diagrams for the Margo ecosystem.
- [ ] Investigate the EU Cyber Resilience Act and its implications for Margo.
- [ ] Review the security work done by the Open RAN Alliance and see if any lessons can be applied to Margo.
- [ ] Break down the high-level security topics discussed into manageable tasks that volunteers can pick up.
- [ ] Volunteers should contact Armand if they want to present on any security topics at the next meeting.

### Minutes

**Meeting Kickoff and Initial Discussions**
Armand discusses housekeeping details, including the creation of issues and the security focus group project. He emphasises the need to break down security discussions into manageable topics, specifically focusing on security-oriented buckets.

**Security Focus Areas and Initial Thoughts**
Erik emphasises the need to discuss workload fleet management, mainly focusing on mutual TLS and proxy issues. He highlights the importance of gaining experience with these technologies in factory settings, raises concerns regarding the security of OCI registries and semantic version strings, and underscores the necessity of documenting security requirements for device management and orchestration.

**Threat Modeling and Compliance**
Erik proposes creating a threat model document that includes physical access threats. Phil agrees and suggests developing accompanying tech surface documents to guide focus areas. Armand emphasises the importance of compliance with standards like NIST, linking it to Margo's security requirements. A speaker member underscores the relevance of the Secure Software Development Framework for federal agency compliance.

**Balancing Specification and Implementation**
Erik and Armand discuss balancing security requirements with flexibility in implementation. Erik proposes leveraging frameworks such as the Linux Foundation's Secure Software Foundation group. Armand stresses that Margo's specifications should avoid dictating implementation methods, while David highlights the EU Cyber Resiliency Act's requirements for secure boot and ongoing vulnerability tracking.

**Margo's Role and Responsibilities**
Erik and Armand discuss Margo's role in ensuring compliance with security standards. Karthi proposes elevating key cybersecurity requirements from the specification to enhance Margoâ€™s compliance. Armand reiterates Margo's goal to unify essential security standards within the specification, while Erik stresses the importance of balancing black-box assumptions with specific requirements.

**Protocols and Communication Standards**
Karthik inquires about the protocols covered under Margo, specifically MQTT, TPF, and HTTP. Armand clarifies that the emphasis is on mutual TLS and the API protocols. Erik suggests prioritising functionality over specific protocols. Armand highlights the importance of securely connecting to app vendors' registries and customer-supplied telemetry services.

**Breaking Down Security Focus Areas**
Armand proposes breaking down security focus areas into manageable buckets, such as workload fleet and device management. He also emphasises the importance of creating a threat model and architecture for each significant component of the ecosystem. Meanwhile, Erik suggests documenting security assumptions and requirements for workload management and orchestration, highlighting the need to consider external dependencies, like OCI registries, and their associated security implications.

**Next Steps and Action Items**
Armand suggests categorising security focus areas into manageable segments, such as workload fleet and device management. He highlights the necessity of developing a threat model and architecture for each major component. Concurrently, Erik emphasises the importance of documenting security assumptions and requirements for workload management, considering external dependencies like OCI registries.

**Final Thoughts and Meeting Conclusion**
Armand emphasises the need for high-level tasks and a focus on security requirements. Erik calls for volunteers to assist in breaking down tasks and drafting documents. Armand suggests using the project dashboard for tracking progress and assigning tasks. The meeting concludes with plans to refine security focus areas in future discussions.
