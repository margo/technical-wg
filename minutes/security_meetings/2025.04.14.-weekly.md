Armand opens the Meeting at 15:00 BST

### Summary Meeting Notes
The meeting focused on the management interface for Margo, discussing cybersecurity standards from NIST and CRA. Key points included the need for automatic updates and the debate between push and pull methods for security updates. Erik emphasized the importance of periodic polling and attestation for device security. Nilanjan proposed a flexible specification allowing both pull and push mechanisms, with a focus on on-demand connections to avoid connection storms. The discussion also covered the exchange of configuration parameters and artefacts, suggesting a multi-part response for updates. The team agreed to continue refining the API decisions and security standards in future meetings.

### Action Items
- [ ] Explore the Cloud Native Computing Foundation's Update Framework (TUF) as a reference for secure package updates.
- [ ] Continue discussing allowing the fleet manager to connect to the device as an exception, and any potential security concerns.
- [ ] Prepare a document summarizing the discussion on management connection principles and share it with the group.

### Minutes
**Discussion on Cyber Security Standards and Management Interface**
Armand opens the meeting, emphasising cyber security and the standardisation of the management interface in Margo. He discusses NIST standards, highlighting the importance of automatic update capabilities and security updates. The conversation shifts to the push versus pull method for security updates, with Erik advocating for periodic polling instead of mandated updates.

**Attestation and Policy Agent Discussion**
Hey everyone! Erik highlights the importance of attestation in ensuring devices run the latest software. He shares how Google uses this method to keep their data centres up to date! They also explore integrating attestation and policy agents in Margo. Erik emphasises the complexity of attestation in contexts like banking and manufacturing.

**Pull Methodology and Notification Service**
Armand introduces a pull methodology with an out-of-band notification service for critical security updates. Erik questions if the notification service is really necessary, suggesting that periodic polling might be enough. Armand brings up Jack's input, stressing compliance with operational requirements. They also discuss the OT architect's role in approving updates and the need for a policy agent in Margo!

**TR 69 Protocol and Management Connection Principles**
Nilanjan introduces the TR 69 protocol, which enables devices to connect to configuration servers. He explores who should initiate the management connection and whether it should be always on or on-demand. Erik raises concerns about polling frequency and connection storms. Nilanjan explains how TR 69 prevents these storms using random time intervals and exponential backoff!

**Exchange of Artefacts and Atomic Transactions**
Nilanjan discusses how configuration parameters and artefacts should be exchanged, highlighting the need for a multi-part response. Erik points out the challenges of downloading large updates in industrial settings and stresses the importance of local repositories. Nilanjan suggests enabling out-of-band software updates from a Git repository or other package managers. Erik underscores the necessity of status updates to keep everyone informed about the software update process!

**Security Concerns and Specification Flexibility**
Armand and Nilanjan discuss security concerns about the fleet manager connecting to the device out of band. Erik suggests that the specification should support various deployment scenarios without requiring a specific method. Nilanjan stresses the need for a flexible specification for different management connection styles. They agree to continue the discussion in the next meeting and invite volunteers to take ownership of items within the security focus group.
