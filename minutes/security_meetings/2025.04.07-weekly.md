Armand opens the meeting at 15:00 BST

### Summary Meeting Notes
The meeting centred on clarifying terminology and definitions in the Margo specification. Arne suggested renaming "application description" to "application definition" and "components" to "workloads," but the team ultimately decided to retain the original terms. They agreed on the naming conventions for registries, settling on "application registry," "component registry," and "container registry." Additionally, the scope of Margo's involvement with marketplaces and the possibility of local replication of components were discussed. The meeting concluded with plans to update the specification and pull requests to reflect these decisions.

### Action Items
- [ ] Update the PR with the agreed terminology changes, including renaming "workload catalogue" to "application catalogue".
- [ ] Provide definitions for the key terms (e.g. application catalogue, component registry) in the Margo specification.
= [ ] Discuss the concept of "service" and how it relates to the application package definition.

### Minutes

**Discussion on Terminology and Specification Updates**
Arne initiated the meeting by sharing his screen and emphasising the importance of clarifying terms in the specification. He referenced a pull request from Silvano that aimed to incorporate terminology changes, though the discussion veered off track. Phil then introduced a new concern regarding the use of "get" for the application package repository, suggesting it might not be suitable for the preview release. Armand concurred, acknowledging that while manual uploads are not ideal, they are not necessarily detrimental.

**Renaming and Defining Application Package Components**
Arne suggests renaming "application description" to "application definition" for clarity. The team discusses changing "components" to "workloads" but decides to stick with "components" for now. Arne proposes calling the "compose package" a "compose archive" to clarify its meaning. The team agrees to maintain the current terminology for now, planning to revisit it later.

**Clarifying Application Registry and Workload Catalogue**
Arne explains the current design of the application package, focusing on its folder structure and document naming. The team discusses the importance of aligning terminology with the specification, especially regarding "application registry" and "workload catalogue." Phil clarifies that the "application catalogue" was meant as a UI for selecting applications, not a separate repository. To avoid confusion, the team agrees to rename "application catalogue" back to "application registry."

**Defining Component Registry and Container Registry**
Arne proposes naming the component registry either "component registry" or "component catalogue." The team discusses the potential use of an OCI registry for container images. Armand suggests calling it a "Container Registry" or "OCI Registry" to keep implementation details vague. The team decides to leave the bottom right registry as a common knowledge item, without defining it in the specification.

**Finalizing Terminology and Next Steps**
Arne summarises the agreed-upon terminology: application registry, component registry, and container registry. The team discusses the need for an entity relationship diagram (ERD) to clearly define the relationships between applications, workloads, and components. Armand brings up a new issue from Josh at Red Hat about expanding Helm deployment profiles to support both OCI and Git repositories. The team agrees to update the PR to reflect the new terminology and definitions and to keep working on the ERD and related issues.
