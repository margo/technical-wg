## Margo Observability Requirements Focus Group Meeting - 18 June 2024

### Attendees:
* Dr. Amir Varastehhajipour (Siemens)
* Armand Craig (Rockwell Automation) - Chair
* Daniel Lazaro (AVEVA)
* Deepak Gunjal (Capgemini)
* Erik Nordmark (ZEDEDA)
* Himanshu Singh (Capgemini)
* Jory Burson (The Linux Foundation)
* Julien Duquesnay (Schneider Electric)
* Philip Presson (ABB) - Chair

### Minutes
The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings. Discussion topics included were: 

* Review of Application Observability:
   - Discussion on setting up a review of application observability with the strategic team to ensure alignment.
   - Importance of ensuring that telemetry data is correctly aligned with strategic team expectations.
 * Updates on Research and Prototyping:
   - Philip is focused on setting up a sandbox environment to match the specification and ensure all necessary elements are captured.
   - Amir is working on configuring standalone devices to connect to the observability platform and making it reproducible with scripts.
* Time Synchronization Discussion:
   - Discussion on the need for time synchronization across devices and applications.
   - Agreement that the responsibility for time synchronization lies with the device, and the application should not need to handle it separately.
* Scope of Observability:
   - Clarification on the scope of observability within Margo, focusing on interoperability rather than adding new functionalities.
   - Discussion on potential enhancements like relating traces, logs, and metrics for root cause analysis.
* Resource Consumption and Recommendations:
   - Consideration of resource consumption for observability tools, such as the OpenTelemetry collector.
   - Discussion on whether to provide specific recommendations for resource allocation based on device size and application needs.

**Open Items**
   - Need a couple of team members to review and approve the pending PR to close it out.
   - Further research into the resource consumption of the OpenTelemetry collector and other observability tools.
   - Consideration of providing guidelines or recommendations for resource allocation.
   - Discuss time synchronization requirements with the device requirement working group to ensure proper alignment.
   - Sync with the strategic team to ensure no critical use cases or requirements are overlooked in the observability framework.
   - Continue configuring and testing the standalone devices and sandbox environment to validate the specification and ensure all necessary elements are captured.
