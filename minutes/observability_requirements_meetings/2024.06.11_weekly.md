### Minutes
The call was recorded and is available to Members at [https://openprofile.dev](https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings). Discussion topics included were: 

* PR Review and Updates
  - Philip Presson highlighted the PR created over a week ago, seeking reviews and approvals to merge changes clarifying some language in the documentation.

* Research Prototype Development
  - Philip provided an update on the research prototype, focusing on integrating virtual devices and workload orchestration. Key components implemented include:
    - OTEL collector setup.
    - Prometheus and Loki log and metric collection.
    - Grafana setup to visualize metrics and logs from virtual machines.

* Specifications and Requirements
  - Discussion around the specification for the workload orchestration layer, emphasizing that while the specification details the use of the OpenTelemetry collector, it does not mandate specific tools or configurations. The focus is on ensuring data export from the collector.

* Data Point Definition and Research
  - Jannis Achstetter raised the question about specifying data points and ensuring that all necessary metrics are collected by the OpenTelemetry collector. Philip confirmed that the specification currently defines certain receivers but will need further refinement based on ongoing research.

**Open Items**
* Members are encouraged to review Philip's PR on the documentation. No comments or approvals have been received yet.
* Continued research is needed to finalize the set of metrics and ensure the specification is comprehensive. Philip and Amir will collaborate on this, and others are invited to assist.
* Philip will work on refining the OTEL daemon set deployment and ensuring data is correctly pushed to the workload orchestration layer.
* Philip and Amir to sync up on the next steps. The schedule for the working group calls will be adjusted to accommodate everyone's availability.
