Philip Presson led the call, providing context that the focus group would be focusing on deployment models and observability requirements for container platforms, particularly in the context of using OpenTelemetry. 

The discussion broadly covered: 
* Ensuring compatibility and flexibility across different deployment environments such as Kubernetes, Docker, and Podman.
* Version Management: A decision is needed on which version of the OpenTelemetry specification to base the first release. This discussion was deferred until a broader strategy on version management for dependent frameworks is established.
* Deployment Models:
  * Various deployment models were discussed, emphasizing the necessity to support multiple environments like Kubernetes clusters and single-node clusters.
  * A sidecar deployment model was noted as potentially useful but requires further validation to ensure applications do not need to be pre-configured for its integration.

**Action Items:**
* Improve Document Descriptions: Philip will update descriptions and details within the project board drafts to provide clearer guidance.
* Research Deployment Models: Additional research is required to determine if the sidecar deployment can be dynamically integrated without prior application configuration.
* Decide on OpenTelemetry Version: The team needs to decide on which version of the OpenTelemetry specification to use for the initial release. This decision will be revisited after a broader discussion on version management strategy.
* Device Vendor Responsibilities: It was clarified that device vendors are responsible for including necessary components like the OpenTelemetry collector and client within the devices out-of-the-box.
