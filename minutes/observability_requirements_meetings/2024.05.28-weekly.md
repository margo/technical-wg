## Margo Observability Requirements Focus Group Meeting - 28 May 2024

### Attendees:
* Dr. Amir Varastehhajipour (Siemens)
* Armand Craig (Rockwell Automation)
* Arne Broring (Siemens)
* Erik Nordmark (ZEDADA)
* Merrill Harriman (Schneider Electric)
* Michael Sanchez (Schneider Electric)
* Philip Presson (ABB) - Chair

### Minutes
The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev. The discussion broadly covered:

* Demo and Environment Setup:
   - A demo was presented showcasing the current environment setup with Docker and Kubernetes.
   - Key components include Jaeger, Prometheus, Loki, Grafana, and Otel Collector
   - Focus on setting up secure communication and validating default configurations.

* Repositories and Contribution Guidelines:
   - Discussion on creating repositories for different focus groups with minimal overhead.
   - Agreement that initial focus group repositories should not have rigorous checks.
   - Blueprints and official reference implementation repositories will require more rigor.

* Observability and Scope:
   - Debate on the depth of observability, including kernel space and user space.
   - The need for a clear boundary between device apps observability and application observability.
   - Consideration of resource constraints and whether the hotel collector needs to be on the device or can be proxied off-device.

* Standards and Requirements:
   - Mention of OPAFâ€™s push for Redfish for kernel observability information.
   - Agreement to investigate nominal resource requirements for the otel collector during testing.
   - Discussion on ensuring secure communication for data collection and export.

**Open Items:**

   - Armand Craig to initiate the creation of contribution repositories for focus groups within the Margo GitHub organization.
   - Philip and Amir to monitor and document the resource requirements of the otel collector during their testing phase.
   - Focus group leads to document use cases and add them to the project board for review and consideration for release one.
   - Investigate the feasibility and implementation of Redfish for kernel observability and report findings.
   - Encourage team members to read through the current observability specifications and provide feedback.
   - Seek additional volunteers to assist Philip and Amir with their ongoing work.
