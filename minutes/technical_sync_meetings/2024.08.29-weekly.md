   - Proposed deadlines for feedback: Soft deadline on September 5, hard deadline on September 12.
   - Importance of setting clear deadlines to ensure timely feedback.

* Scope Expansion and Focus:
   - Tim Mirth advised against expanding the scope too broadly to avoid the pitfalls of projects like OPath and OPC UA, suggesting a focus on doing a few things well.
   - Agreement that any scope expansion should be clearly defined and only pursued when there is a dedicated leader.

* Technical Focus Groups:
   - Updates on the progress of various focus groups, including workload orchestration, device requirements, and observability.
   - A call for additional eyes on the pre-draft state of the specification to move towards a draft state.

* Housekeeping:
