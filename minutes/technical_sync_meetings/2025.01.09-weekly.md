### Summary meeting notes
The meeting focused on the introduction and potential adoption of Link ML for specifying and validating API resources. Silvano presented Link ML as a tool that simplifies the creation and validation of API specifications, generating consistent documentation and JSON schemas. The tool can also validate examples against the schema and generate OpenAPI specifications. The team discussed the benefits of using Link ML for app package definitions and compliance testing. Additionally, they reviewed the status of focus groups, including the workload management interface and app package focus groups, and emphasized the need to finalize tooling and documentation for the upcoming 2025 kickoff meeting.


### Minutes

**Introduction to Link ML Presentation** -
Armand invites Silvano to present Link ML, a modeling language. Silvano starts by outlining the challenges and pointing out the inconsistencies in API specifications. He discusses the manual work needed to uphold consistency in markdown documents and stresses the necessity for a more systematic approach. Silvano then presents Link ML as the solution, highlighting its user-friendly editing, clear readability, and capabilities to produce documentation and validate constraints.

**Detailed Explanation of Link ML** -
Silvano offers a comprehensive overview of Link ML, highlighting its capability to define schemas and constraints and produce multiple resources. He illustrates how Link ML can effectively represent the target state of the API specification and create uniform HTML documentation. Furthermore, Silvano describes how Jinja2 templates convert the Link ML specification into markdown and HTML formats. He also addresses the validation procedure, emphasizing the ability to generate JSON schemas and check examples against the defined schema.

**Validation and Implementation of Link ML** -
Silvano illustrates the validation process by presenting counterexamples to confirm that the constraints function correctly. He notes the application of GitHub Actions for validation and the capability to produce JSON schemas for OpenAPI specifications. Arne and Silvano converse about the advantages of utilizing Link ML, which includes creating a conformance test suite and assuring documentation consistency. Silvano highlights Link ML's flexibility, permitting manual adjustments when necessary, along with its ability to generate markdown and JSON schemas.

**Discussion on REST API and OpenAPI** -
Julien inquires whether Link ML can be utilized to define REST APIs and produce OpenAPI specifications. Silvano clarifies that Link ML is more appropriate for modelling resources, while OpenAPI is centred on detailing REST APIs. He recommends creating JSON schemas from Link ML for incorporation into the OpenAPI specification. Furthermore, Silvano notes the difficulties of managing large JSON schemas and mentions the community's continuous efforts to enhance the generators.

**Feedback and Next Steps for Link ML** -
Armand and Silvano discuss using Link ML to define app packages and test compliance. Silvano suggests creating a pull request to provide the Link ML specification and its documentation. They both recognize the necessity of completing the tools and documentation for the upcoming preview release. Silvano highlights no reliance on Link ML or the associated tools, permitting manual processes when necessary.

**Agenda for 2025 Kickoff Meeting** -
Armand presents the agenda for the 2025 kickoff meeting, which includes addressing open issues and finalizing the strategy for the Margo management interface. He emphasizes the importance of prioritizing issues and introduces the new term "platform" within the technical vocabulary. Armand recommends hosting show-and-tell sessions alongside hackathons to showcase progress and collaborate on prototypes. Additionally, he suggests a discussion on security and developing a framework to effectively manage outsourced development resources.

**Focus Group Updates** -
Armand shares updates regarding the app package and workload management interface focus groups. He notes the choice to implement a REST API for the management interface and mentions the ongoing talks surrounding Helm ingestion. Arne updates on the app package focus group, stressing the need to finalize the specification and reference implementation. Additionally, Armand emphasizes the importance of using labels to categorize issues, keeping attention on the preview release.

**Open PR and Final Remarks** -
Armand highlights the open pull request regarding updates to personas and technical terminology. He proposes that the steering committee and technical working group discuss this pull request. Additionally, Armand urges participants to examine and provide feedback on the open issues marked for the preview release. He wraps up the meeting by expressing gratitude for everyone's involvement and reminding them once more to review the open issues.
