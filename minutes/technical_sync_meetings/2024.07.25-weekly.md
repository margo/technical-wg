  - Decision to make the Technical Working Group Repository public to expose meeting minutes.
  - Agreement to make individual working group prototype repositories private as they are not intended for public collaboration or consumption.
  - Discussion on the importance of transparency versus the risk of confusion from exposing incomplete or in-progress work to the public.

* Navigation and Documentation Structure:
  - Restructuring Navigation:
    - Introduction of three main sections for the Margo project: Application Standards, Device Interoperability Standards, and Orchestration Standards.
    - Agreement on the need to align the folder structure in the specification repository with the new navigation.

* Granularity in Documentation:
  - Emphasis on breaking down documentation into granular markdown files focused on specific topics for easier maintenance and clarity.

* Security Focus Group:
  - Recognition of the need for a dedicated focus group on security to address threat modeling and security-related topics across the Margo ecosystem.
  - Decision to delay the formation of this focus group until a suitable leader is identified.

  - Make individual working group prototype repositories private.
  - Update the blueprint repository to include necessary rules and compliance checks.
  - Implement the new navigation structure in the specification repository.
