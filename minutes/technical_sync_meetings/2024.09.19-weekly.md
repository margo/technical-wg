### Minutes
The call was recorded and is available to Members at [https://openprofile.dev](https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings). Key discussion points included:

* Wasm and Margo Integration:
   - Discussion on integrating Wasm workloads within the Margo framework.
   - Importance of defining device requirements for supporting Wasm workloads.
   - Challenges in aligning Wasm capabilities with current Margo specifications, which primarily support OCI-compliant runtimes like Docker.

* Device Classification and Requirements:
   - Proposal to classify devices into three categories: browser-based, Linux-based, and truly embedded devices.
   - Need to define a clear specification for devices to support different types of workloads, particularly Wasm and traditional containers.
   - Discussion on creating multiple classes of Margo-compliant devices, including those supporting only Wasm or both Wasm and Docker containers.

* Kubernetes Operators:
   - Importance of supporting Kubernetes operators within the Margo framework.
   - Operators provide better integration and management for applications on Kubernetes, reducing manual configurations.
   - Consideration of adding operator support as a mandatory feature for Margo-compliant Kubernetes clusters.

* Capabilities and Compatibility:
   - The need for a mechanism to describe and query the capabilities of devices and workloads.
   - Wasm offers a structured way to define inputs and outputs, which could be leveraged to match workloads with device capabilities.
   - Potential integration of these mechanisms into Margo to ensure proper workload-device compatibility.

**Open Items:**
   - Develop a clear specification for device requirements that support Wasm workloads, including minimum capabilities and potential dependencies.
   - Explore creating a new classification for devices that support Wasm but not OCI runtimes.
   - Add support for Kubernetes operators within the Margo specification.
   - Define a process for specifying and deploying operators on Margo-compliant devices.
   - Document the different classes of devices and the types of workloads they can support.
   - Clarify the requirements for Wasm and OCI container workloads to avoid confusion for device vendors and developers.
   - Schedule a follow-up meeting to delve deeper into Wasm capabilities and their alignment with the Margo specification.
   - Invite experts from Kubernetes and Helm to provide insights into operator integration and best practices.
