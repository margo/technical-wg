### Minutes
The call was recorded and is available to Members at [https://openprofile.dev](https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings). 

### General Meeting Notes
The team discussed the scope for the preview release of the Margo specification, focusing on interoperable application definition, deployment, and workload management. Key points included the need to push the deadline for vendor feedback, the onboarding of new colleagues, and the importance of internal and external feedback. The scope aims to enable prototyping and exploration of solutions, with a focus on application packaging, artifact hosting, and device requirements. The team debated the inclusion of extended Kubernetes roles and the use of open GitOps, ultimately deciding to finalize these details before the preview release. The next steps involve refining the scope and gathering feedback from the steering committee.

### Minutes
**Preview Release Scope and Deadline Extension** -
Armand introduces the main topic: discussing the preview release scope proposals and comments.
Armand mentions the need to push the due date for vendor votes due to insufficient responses.
Christian appreciates the extension and shares news about onboarding two new colleagues from Sean's.
Armand emphasizes the collaborative nature of the discussion between technical and steering committee folks.

**Intent and Goals of Preview Release** -
Armand explains the preview release's purpose: focusing on interoperable application definition, deployment, and workload management.
The release aims to spark additional contributions and feedback from the community.
The goal is to enable the Margo workload orchestration definition and device deployment definitions.
Armand mentions the need for a preview or beta reference implementation to help developers understand the ecosystem.

**Application Management Scope** -
Armand discusses the application management scope, focusing on packaging, artifact hosting, and publishing the Margo dimel.
The specification for application management is considered far along and expected to garner good feedback.
Armand addresses comments about the multiplicity in the YAML file and clarifies the intent for one application description file with multiple Helm charts.
Tom Counihan and Armand discuss the state machine nuances related to multiple Helm charts and deployment status updates.

**Device Requirements and Cluster Management** -
Armand proposes capping device requirements to two roles: cluster leader and worker, excluding cluster worker for now.
Merrill agrees with the scope, noting that the cluster will be homogeneous from one vendor.
Erik and Armand discuss the assumption that clusters are provisioned separately and the need for a textual description on how to provision a cluster.
Armand emphasizes the importance of providing a local ecosystem setup guide for users unfamiliar with Kubernetes or Ubuntu.

**Management Interface and Device Capabilities** -
Armand outlines the goals for the management interface: interpreting deployment specs, providing deployment status, and providing device capabilities information.
The team has progressed with the Margo management interface, including hosting services and integrating with tools like Helm and Docker Compose.
Armand mentions excluding policy agent, enrollment, and secure certificate management from the current scope.
Speaker 5 raises concerns about understanding device capabilities beyond basic hardware specifications.

**Workload Management Interface Scope** -
Armand defines the workload management interface scope: deploying, updating, and reconfiguring workloads.
The scope includes hosting management interface endpoints and building client services for device deployment.
Armand discusses the decision to use open gitops and the need for further research and technical spikes to determine the best approach.
Merrill and Armand agree that addressing the workload management interface before releasing the preview scope is crucial to maintaining the interoperability promises.

**Final Comments and Next Steps** -
Armand summarizes the intent and deliverables for the preview release, emphasizing the need for feedback and contributions.
Christian and Armand discuss the importance of internal and external feedback for the preview release.
Armand plans to send an email targeting a new deadline for vendor reviews and feedback next week.
The meeting concludes with no further comments or concerns, and participants agree to reconvene next week.

### Action Items
- [ ] Push the deadline for the scope proposals to next Thursday.
- [ ] Onboard the new colleagues from Sean's team and have them provide feedback on the scope proposals.
- [ ] Review the scope proposals and provide feedback as a collective.
