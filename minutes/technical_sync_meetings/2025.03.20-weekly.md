Armand opens the meeting at 15:00 GMT

### Summary Meeting Notes

The meeting reviewed the Margo project's progress, focusing on Symphony components for open implementation. Armand requested feedback on the proposal, noting limited responses. Bart emphasised the need to accelerate the process, proposing Symphony as a starting point. Erik expressed concerns about the reference implementation's clarity and the necessity for multiple open implementations. Stefan highlighted the importance of representing diverse alternatives. Hashi and Phil discussed Symphony's practical benefits for testing and workflow demonstrations. The group agreed to refine the proposal further and establish a technical working group for ongoing discussions.

### Action Items
- [ ] Connect with Hashi to understand the work being done in the background to support the Symphony proposal.
- [ ] Follow up with Phil on the "code first sandbox" and the plan for a common infrastructure hosted by the Linux Foundation.
- [ ] Spin up a technical working group channel on Discord to facilitate faster feedback loops on the Symphony proposal.
- [ ] Schedule a separate meeting for a deep dive presentation on the Symphony architecture to address the questions raised.
- [ ] Propose reference architectures to help discuss where Margo devices exist in the field.
- [ ] Join the security focus group that starts on Monday at 10am Eastern, or provide feedback on the main topics discussed.

**Discussion on Code First Homework and Security Focus Group**
Armand initiates the meeting by outlining the agenda, which includes feedback on the code-first homework and the security focus group. He stresses the significance of the security focus group to prevent overlooking critical security topics. Additionally, he discusses the soft and hard deadlines for feedback on the Symphony components proposal, noting a lack of substantial responses and the urgency to accelerate the release.

**Feedback on Symphony Proposal and Initial Queries**
Erik expresses concerns regarding the lack of responses to initial questions about the Symphony proposal. Armand acknowledges the need for more information and the urgency of feedback. Bart indicates that Erik's questions require follow-up and notes the steering committee's awareness of the need for acceleration, expressing surprise at the minimal feedback from other members.

**Clarification on Acceleration and Specification**
Tom Counihan inquires about the term "acceleration vehicle" and the expectations regarding code to support the specification. Bart responds by highlighting the necessity of tangible items to replicate the current pre-draft state. He underscores the importance of a testing environment before finalising the specification and proposes using open source components from Eclipse Symphony to facilitate implementation.

**Concerns About Reference Implementation and Alternatives**
Stefan expresses concerns about the current polling mechanisms and suggests exploring alternative options for the reference implementation. Armand clarifies that the objective is to adjust Symphony based on the working group's decisions, rather than fully adopting it. Bart highlights the necessity of multiple open implementations to encourage adoption.

**Discussion on API Mockups and AI-Aided Tools**
Hashi discusses the API-first approach of Symphony, highlighting the ability to mock up API shapes prior to implementation. They also mention the development of an AI-aided tool designed to generate API code from Markdown files, aiming to streamline the process for testing various proposals and emphasising the necessity of a usable environment for faster evolution.

**Value of Symphony for Practical Implementation**
Phil emphasises Symphony's value in facilitating functional workflows and Canary deployments. He suggests leveraging Symphony to test and refine the specification to meet requirements more effectively. Armand concurs and stresses the importance of having tangible results for the community. He intends to follow up with Hashi regarding the hands-on approach and the code-first sandbox.

**Clarification on Code First and Reference Implementation**
Erik expresses confusion about the distinction between a code-first and reference implementation. Armand clarifies that the goal is to release the first preview, reflecting the progress made in the specification. He emphasises the importance of having a tangible product to present to the community for feedback. Erik suggests scheduling a follow-up discussion regarding due dates and the path forward.

**Iterative Approach and Open Implementation**
Bart highlights the importance of an iterative approach and multiple open implementations for Margo's success. He suggests discussing the essential building blocks for its rapid adoption in commercial offerings. Furthermore, Bart advocates for the availability of an end-to-end prototype for testing and community feedback.

**Feedback on Symphony and Implementation Challenges**
Andre expresses concerns regarding the complexity of implementing Symphony and suggests a deep dive architecture discussion. Armand concurs and highlights the necessity of a presentation to summarise responses to initial queries. Additionally, he plans to establish a chat channel in the Margo community for ongoing discussions, stressing the importance of updating everyone on progress.

**Next Steps and Security Focus Group**
Armand emphasises the need for reference architectures to initiate discussions on Margo devices. He highlights the significance of a testing sequence to ensure informed decisions across various environments. Furthermore, Armand announces the launch of the security focus group on Monday, encouraging everyone to join and contribute feedback on key topics.
