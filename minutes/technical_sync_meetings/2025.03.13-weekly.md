**Armand opened the meeting at 15:00 GMT**

### Summary Meeting Notes
The meeting focused on feedback and the subsequent steps for integrating Symphony with the Margo project. Armand mentioned creating a new folder in the Technical Working Group repository for questions related to Symphony and the code-first proposal. Key topics included the Maestro CLI tool, Symphony's orchestration back end, and Margo API integration. Erik highlighted the importance of mutual TLS and interoperability. Phil suggested utilizing Symphony to test and enhance components. Armand proposed a tentative deadline for vendor feedback by next week and stressed the necessity of shared experiences and reference architectures to guide API decision-making.

### Action Items
- [ ] Could you provide feedback on the Symphony proposal in the designated GitHub location by next week?
- [ ] Reach out to Hashi to ensure their participation in the next meeting to address any questions about Symphony.
- [ ] Add the link to Eric's previous discussion on object signing and encryption to the shared experiences folder.
- [ ] Contribute any field experiences or reference architectures to the designated folders in the Technical Working Group repository.

### Minutes
**Feedback on Code First Proposal** -
Armand suggests establishing a new document to gather feedback on the initial code proposal, mentioning key areas such as the Maestro CLI tool and the Symphony orchestration back end. He elaborates on the capabilities of the Maestro CLI tool, emphasizing its ability to generate workloads and oversee devices. Additionally, the discussion covers the Symphony orchestration framework, detailing its implementation of the app object model and its integration with Kubernetes using Kubectl. Armand underscores the necessity for a visual GUI as well as an OTEL back end for the orchestrator component, stressing the importance of tying the API into the Symphony back end.

**Evaluation and Security Considerations** -
Erik emphasizes the importance of grasping security assumptions and mutual TLS for ensuring interoperability. He suggests creating a piece of API endpoint code that integrates with different systems, such as Symphony and other fleet management solutions. Additionally, there is a conversation about developing a reference implementation module that could be incorporated into Symphony and other platforms. Phil backs the concept of using Symphony to implement a solution for establishing functionality, with intentions to enhance it based on the feedback collected.

**Progress and Next Steps** -
Armand talks about his advancements with Symphony, specifically creating a Kubernetes cluster and integrating workloads. He intends to collaborate with Hashi to give feedback on Symphony’s documentation and integration aspects. Armand proposes establishing a soft deadline for vendors to offer feedback on the initial code proposal by next week. There’s a discussion about the necessity of defining clear tasks for external development teams and encouraging community members to engage in Symphony integration.

**Shared Experiences and API Proposals** -
Armand presents the concept of sharing real-world experiences to support API decisions. He creates new folders in the Technical Working Group repository dedicated to shared experiences and reference architectures. There is a discussion regarding the three primary options for the API proposals: OCI, base64 hashes, and bi-directional push using HTTP/2. Armand stresses the importance of shared experiences to help refine one of these options and unify on a solution.

**Reference Architectures and Networking Considerations** -
Armand showcases a reference architecture for Margo devices, illustrating their potential locations within the edge network. The discussion covers various networking scenarios, such as layer two and layer three VLANs, along with their impact on device management. Erik recommends leveraging port-based VLANs and device management features to set up Margo devices. Armand emphasizes the necessity of understanding network environment assumptions and stresses the importance of Margo devices operating independently within the safe zone.

**Final Discussion and Meeting Conclusion**
Armand highlights the importance of outlining specific tasks for external development teams and collecting community feedback regarding Symphony integration. 
There is a discussion about creating a focus group list on Discord for the Technical Working Group and API discussions. 
Armand suggests moving information from Discord to the Technical Working Group repository to enhance organization. 
The meeting concludes with Armand thanking everyone for their participation and encouraging them to check the meeting minutes and agendas for further details.
