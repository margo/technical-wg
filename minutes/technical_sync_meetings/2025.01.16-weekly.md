**Armand opens the meeting at 1500 GMT**

### Summary meeting notes
The team covered several, particularly adopting the Mermaid tool for UML and flow diagrams, praised for its user-friendliness and GitHub integration. They examined the technical workshop agenda, focusing on key issues such as endpoint discovery, the target environments for demos, and finalizing the tools needed. Emphasis was placed on the necessity of standardizing diagram conventions and tracking requirements. The proposal to promote end-to-end prototype repositories received support on the condition that it does not impede rapid development. Phil is set to present a proof of concept for Kubernetes and workload deployment. The need for a consensus on a requirement tracking tool was underlined to prevent future complications.

### Meeting Minutes
Armand presents the agenda and discusses the proposal for the mermaid drawing tool. He outlines the difficulties of using draw.io for managing diagram versions. Next, Armand displays a sequence diagram made with Mermaid, comparing it to the version created in draw.io. Stephen points out that GitHub has built-in support for basic mermaid rendering, eliminating the need for a plugin. Andreas and Stephen share tips for embedding mermaid diagrams in Markdown and MK documentation.

**Automation Fair Videos and Technical Workshop Prioritization**
Armand discusses uploading videos from the Automation Fair to the groups.io platform to improve familiarity with Margo. He also proposes launching a YouTube series for upcoming releases and demonstrations. Armand outlines the topics for the technical workshop, including reviewing open issues, identifying target environments for demos, and finalizing tool sets. He emphasizes breaking down significant challenges into smaller, more manageable tasks. Additionally, Armand and Phil highlight the need for a framework for outsourced development and underscore the necessity of standardizing requirements tracking within Margo.

**Workload Management Interface and Prototype Repositories**
Armand offers an update regarding the workload management interface and the suggested implementation of REST API functions. He brings up a Sega video showcasing a Docker-enabled edge's translation and deployment process. Armand suggests that making the end-to-end prototype and blueprint repositories public could enhance transparency and collaboration. Phil raises concerns about sustaining a fast development pace while ensuring timely PR approvals. Armand and Phil address the importance of clear disclaimers indicating that the prototype code is not intended for production use.

**End-to-End POC and App Observability**
Phil presented a detailed overview of the end-to-end Proof of Concept (POC) for Kubernetes and workload deployment. He highlighted the importance of viewing the recorded POC demo before the workshop. Armand noted the progress made on the REST API and its ability to accelerate the preview release. Additionally, he emphasized the need for a tool to track requirements and urged a consensus on which tool to select. Sean Mcilroy underscored the necessity for group consensus on any chosen tool to avoid future complications.

**Meeting Conclusion**
Armand requests any last thoughts or insights on the topics addressed. He expresses gratitude to everyone for their contributions throughout the week. The meeting ends with a reminder to go over the minutes and share any further feedback.
