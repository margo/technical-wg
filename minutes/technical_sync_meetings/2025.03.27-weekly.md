**Refocusing on Preview Release One**

The technical working group had previously defined the scope for preview release one, but there's a sense that discussions have drifted away from those specific goals.    
There's a need to realign and confirm the scope of preview release one, possibly requiring a review with the product management team.    
Clarification is needed on whether the product management group's direction aligns with the agreed-upon preview release one scope.    
Armand Craig from Rockwell Automation is working to align the requirements from the product management group with the features being developed by the technical working groups.    
The product management group has started introducing milestones, which is a new development.    
It was emphasized that dates on these milestones should be approached cautiously, as the technical working group needs to provide input on the effort required.    

**Requirements and Process**

Armand Craig provided an update on the requirements process, noting that it's beginning to take shape.    
There have been improvements in how the product management group is writing requirements, including the use of parent and child epics.    

### Action Items
- Clarify and reaffirm the scope of preview release one.    
- Ensure alignment between the product management group and the technical working group on the priorities and scope of preview release one.    
- Finalize the child epics from the product management group and get agreement from all vendors.    
- Continue developing features based on the current direction, but be prepared to adjust based on finalized requirements.    

## Next Steps
- Product management group to provide finalized child epics with clear tags for preview release one.    
- Technical working group to review and provide feedback on the product management group’s proposals, including scope and deadlines.    
- Continue discussions between the technical working group and the product management group to ensure alignment and shared understanding of preview release one objectives.
