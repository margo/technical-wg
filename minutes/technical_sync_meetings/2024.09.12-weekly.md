### Minutes
The call was recorded and is available to Members at [https://openprofile.dev](https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings). Key discussion points included:

* Overview of WebAssembly (Wasm):
   - **Liam Randall (Cosmonic)** presented an in-depth introduction to WebAssembly and its applications beyond the web browser.
   - Key points covered:
     - History and evolution of WebAssembly as an open W3C standard.
     - The benefits of WebAssembly in terms of size, speed, portability, and polyglot support.
     - Real-world applications of WebAssembly, including use cases in edge computing by companies like Fastly, Cloudflare, and Akamai.
     - Bytecode Alliance and the development of WebAssembly standards, specifically Wazi (WebAssembly System Interface).

* Technical Deep Dive:
   - Discussion on the differences between various Wasm engines and their respective APIs.
   - Highlighted the adoption of Wazi point 1 and the future movement towards Wazi point 2, focusing on the evolving standards and capabilities.

* Wasm Cloud:
   - Introduction to Wasm Cloud, a cloud-native platform that leverages WebAssembly.
   - Explanation of the component model that allows for fine-grained modularization and reusability of code.
   - Compatibility and integration with existing tools and standards, including Kubernetes and OCI (Open Container Initiative).

* Project Ochre presentation by Atym:
   - **Jason Shepherd (Atym)** and **Stephen Berard (Atym)** presented Project Ochre, an open-source project focused on enabling cloud-native capabilities on resource-constrained devices (1 MB to 1 GB memory).
   - Key features of Ochre:
     - Combines Zephyr RTOS with WebAssembly to create a lightweight virtualization layer.
     - Targeting devices that cannot run traditional containerization tools like Docker.
     - Utilizes standard OCI container registries and supports a broad range of languages.
     - Focus on embedded and industrial applications with a commitment to leveraging open standards.

* Future Directions and Integration:
   - Potential alignment and standardization efforts within the WebAssembly community, particularly around packaging and deployment.
   - Discussion on interoperability with the Margo architecture and broader ecosystem.

* Questions and Clarifications:
   - Julien Duquesnay inquired about compatibility between different Wasm engines.
   - Christian Storm raised questions regarding the interface and security for embedded devices using WebAssembly.

**Open Items**
   - Share the presentation decks and links with attendees.
   - Coordinate follow-up discussions on specific technical questions raised during the meeting.
   - Liam Randall (Cosmonic) & Stephen Berard (Atym):
       - Continue the work on standardizing the Wasm OCI artifact layout.
       - Provide further documentation and resources on their respective projects for the Margo community.
