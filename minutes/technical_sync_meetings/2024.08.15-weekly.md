### Minutes
The call was recorded and is available to Members at [https://openprofile.dev](https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings). Key discussion points included:

* Device Orchestration and Management:
   - Armand Craig discussed the migration from weekly device management meetings to Discord discussions for more asynchronous collaboration.
   - A focus on device orchestration requirements was introduced, with the creation of dedicated discussion channels for subtopics such as security and orchestration.

* Introduction to FIDO Device Onboarding (FDO) by Intel:
   - Geoffrey Cooper from Intel presented an overview of FIDO Device Onboarding (FDO) as a flexible solution for automating device onboarding in secure and scalable ways.
   - Key points:
     - FDO is designed to support automatic onboarding by securely establishing trust between a device and the target environment.
     - The onboarding process involves attestation, ownership vouchers, and flexible infrastructure for both closed and open networks.

* Margo Ecosystem and Device Onboarding Integration:
   - The group discussed whether FIDO should be the preferred device onboarding method within Margo. Concerns were raised about the potential need for multiple onboarding solutions and the additional infrastructure complexity this could introduce.
   - The conversation will continue in the Discord channel, focusing on whether to mandate a single onboarding solution or provide flexibility for vendors and users.

* Discussion on Security Standards:
   - A related IETF standard (RFC 9421) was mentioned as a potentially relevant security framework, with further investigation ongoing.

* Tracking Requirements and Compliance Testing:
   - Philip Presson raised the need for standardized numbering of requirements within the Margo specification. This would ensure traceability between the requirements and the corresponding compliance test cases.
   - The group agreed on the importance of clear and testable requirements, which could be tagged and numbered for easier reference.

* Workload Orchestration Agent Updates:
   - Armand Craig is working on breaking down a large pull request into smaller, manageable issues to allow for better feedback and consensus-building among the working group.

**Open Items**
   - Armand and Jory will update the roles and permissions for new members to ensure visibility of key channels.
   - Further discussion in Discord on whether FIDO should be mandated as the preferred onboarding solution in the Margo ecosystem.
   - Begin integrating requirement numbering into the specification to improve traceability and testability.
   - Armand to distribute the split issues for more detailed feedback from the working group.
