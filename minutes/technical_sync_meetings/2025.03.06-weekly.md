### Armand Opens the meeting at 15:00

### Summary Meeting Notes
The meeting discussed the proposal to accelerate Margo's development in 2025 by adopting a code-first approach. Armand introduced Symphony, an open-source orchestration engine, to create a sandbox for prototyping and feedback. Symphony's components, such as Helm charts and Docker providers, will be integrated with Margo's object model and API. The goal is to provide a tangible system for iterative development and to ensure interoperability. Concerns were raised about the potential constraints of using Symphony and the need for flexibility in prototyping. Further sessions were proposed to address these concerns and ensure alignment with Margo's goals.

### Minutes

**Introduction to the Weekly Sync and Proposal for Margo 2025**
Armand greets everyone at the weekly sync and introduces the main objective: to present a proposal for accelerating Margo in 2025. He notes that Hashi from Microsoft and Phil from ABB will participate in the presentation. The primary aim is to shift Margo towards a code-first approach, minimizing extensive specification discussions. Armand describes the strategy to enhance the TWG by adding a product owner and a scrum team and assessing open-source toolboxes for comprehensive workflows.

**Code-First Approach and Its Benefits**
Phil discusses the existing specification writing process and its shortcomings, stressing the importance of adopting a code-first approach. This approach allows for direct implementation of solutions in a sandbox environment, facilitating immediate feedback and ongoing enhancements. He outlines the steps of creating pull requests, awaiting feedback, and merging changes, noting the advantages of having a concrete implementation. Armand proposes utilizing Symphony components to speed up development efforts within the community.

**Symphony as a Tool for Margo Development**
Armand describes Symphony as an open-source orchestration engine that complements Margo's principles effectively. Although Symphony's object model and state-seeking paradigm are already part of Margo, further effort is necessary to develop a unified architecture. He points out that Symphony is just one of several toolbox proposals under consideration, as other open-source tools like Helm and Kubernetes are also being reviewed. Additionally, Hashi from Microsoft talks about Symphony's integration with Margo, showcasing Symphony's flexibility and extensibility.

**Technical Details of Symphony Integratio**n
Hashi presents a technical proposal for a Margo specification development kit, which includes Helm charts, Docker Compose, and a command-line tool. This kit will incorporate a Margo development server, a Margo portal, and tools to create code skeletons from API proposals. Hashi emphasizes the importance of generative AI in streamlining the development process and reducing manual effort. Armand and Hashi discuss the importance of synchronizing Symphony's concepts with Margo's object model and API selections.

**Concerns and Clarifications on Symphony's Role**
Tom Counihan raises concerns about bootstrapping and authentication requirements for edge nodes in Symphony. Armand and Hashi clarify that Symphony supports mutual certificate authentication and can be customized to Margo's bootstrapping approach. Merrill asks whether Symphony's agent is compatible with Margo's API; Armand responds that Symphony's agent can be replaced by agents that work with Margo. Erik expresses concerns about Symphony's security, identity, and interoperability assumptions. Hashi explains that Symphony is designed for edge environments and supports various communication protocols.

**Evaluation and Next Steps**
Armand highlights that the proposal invites evaluation and feedback from the community, welcoming other toolbox ideas. Phil and Armand discuss the necessity of a unified approach for initial prototyping and refining requirements. Julien raises worries about being limited by Symphony's current concepts and emphasizes the importance of giving Margo the freedom to propose solutions. Armand and Hashi decided to organize follow-up sessions to tackle specific questions and concerns while offering additional documentation and tutorials.

### Action Items
- [ ] Schedule a session with Hashi to review the Symphony architecture, security assumptions, and documentation.
- [ ] Work with Hashi to set up a presentation for the broader group on Symphony, covering the questions and concerns raised.
- [ ] Follow up with the presentation deck, including links to the specific toolbox items being proposed for evaluation.
