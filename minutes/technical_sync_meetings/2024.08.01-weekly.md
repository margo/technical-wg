### Minutes
The call was recorded and is available to Members at [https://openprofile.dev](https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings). Key discussion points included:

* Introductions:
   - Participants introduced themselves, their organizations, and their roles; Many new members have joined, expanding the community.

* Blueprints vs. Reference Implementation:
   - Discussion on the need to focus on blueprints to create initial demonstrable examples.
   - Blueprints can be isolated to specific topics (e.g., application observability) and show patterns or examples based on the specification.
   - Reference implementations should be more comprehensive and focus on the Margo-specific aspects while integrating existing solutions like Otel.

* Common Infrastructure:
   - Emphasis on having a common infrastructure to ensure that all focus groups can work cohesively.
   - Importance of simplifying infrastructure to avoid unnecessary complexities.

* Code First Approach:
   - The community's directive to follow a code-first approach to validate specifications through demonstrable code.
   - Blueprints and reference implementations serve different purposes but should both follow the code-first philosophy.

* Device Management Focus Groups:
   - Need for volunteers to lead focus groups on device management, including device onboarding, updates, observability, and management interfaces.
   - Current focus on defining the interface between workload orchestration and device orchestration.

* Meeting Management and Documentation:
   - Use of GitHub for meeting notes, issues, and pull requests to maintain transparency and a clear paper trail.

**Open Items:**
   - Plan for Taylor from Cosmonic to join the next call to align on engagement and contributions.
   - Make the blueprint repository public.
   - Philip Presson and others to contribute blueprints related to their focus areas (e.g., Otel).
   - Identify and volunteers to lead various new focus groups.
     - Specific call for volunteers to focus on device observability and update management mechanisms.
   - All participants to review the living document of the specification.
   - Contributions and feedback are encouraged before the next meeting.
   - Develop and share common infrastructure guidelines for use across all focus groups.
