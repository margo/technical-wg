## Meeting Minutes

* Assessment of Collaboration:
   - The primary focus was on assessing the progress of the Margo community over the first four months, with a focus on adhering to core principles like "code-first" and avoiding reinventing existing technology.
   - Participants were encouraged to share their views on the current state of collaboration, particularly those who had joined more recently.
   - Josh provided a summary and overview of Margo’s progress on technical deliverables so far as summarized in Progress Update - Margo Aug 21, 2024. Josh noted that the reference implementation and toolkit have not made as much progress as the specification. Josh and Armand spoke to challenges getting contributor input and agreement in the technical working group spaces, and challenges getting the right direction from the strategic group.
   - Bart recorded workshop outcomes and “parking lot” items for followup on slides 8-11 of the agenda deck at Margo Workshop - review deliverables & code first patterns.pptx

* Margo Vision and Deliverables:
   - Margo aims to enable interoperability between apps, devices, and management solutions across various vendors. The focus remains on building an open-source ecosystem with three key pillars: 
     - **Open-source reference implementation**: To demonstrate, educate, and enable reuse.
     - **Open-standard specification**: To allow flexibility for vendors while ensuring interoperability.
     - **Open-source compliance testing toolkit**: To build trust and consistency in the ecosystem.

* Challenges with Kubernetes and Interoperability:
   - There was a detailed discussion on the management of Kubernetes variants and whether abstraction layers or patterns could enable interoperability between devices using different Kubernetes distributions.
   - The community recognized that while commercial solutions exist, there is a need for a clear, standardized approach in the Margo community.

* Involvement of End Users:
   - The involvement of end users or customers was seen as a critical area for the future work. While current participants are mainly vendors and suppliers, there was consensus on bringing end users into the conversation earlier, possibly through focus groups or an advisory board.
   
* Terminology and Communication:
   - The need for clearer, consistent terminology and communication was highlighted, particularly around complex topics like orchestration and management. Aligning definitions and setting clear expectations will be important for engaging both community members and customers.
   - LF Edge has created a few white papers that may be useful for the group to align language, terms and framing; The group expressed interest in adopting LF Edge’s framing https://lfedge.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2022/06/LFEdgeTaxonomyWhitepaper_062322.pdf to help avoid conflation of ideas about orchestration and management.
   - The group also discussed the use of personas and making sure that language and terminology are attuned to the right personas. The group pointed to Margo Primary User Story.pdf as a helpful asset for the language alignment work. 

* Prototype and Code-First Approach:
   - There is a strong consensus on the need for prototyping to validate decisions and specifications.
   - A focused effort is required to break the project into smaller, more manageable components (building blocks) and create prototypes for these components.
   - Concerns about contributing existing blueprints and prototypes without structured feedback or clear next steps. It’s important to ensure these prototypes are purposeful, aiding in decision-making and moving toward reference implementations.
   
* Decision-Making Framework:
   - The need for a clearer, more structured decision-making framework was highlighted. This includes timelines for feedback on proposals and handling pull requests in a way that encourages contributions but also allows timely decisions.
   - Volunteers were identified to help structure and document a clearer decision-making framework with support from the Linux Foundation Program Management team, including defining the rules around decision timelines and contributions.

* Collaboration and Contribution Challenges:
   - There’s a challenge in distributing the workload, especially with limited resources among contributors. Many contributors are providing specifications, but fewer are able to do the coding required.
   - Outsourcing coding was discussed, but concerns were raised regarding managing external resources effectively without burdening the existing contributors. Some participants showed willingness to explore internal resources for prototyping and collaboration across teams.

* Component-Based Development:
   - A suggestion to focus on developing and validating individual components (e.g., device orchestration vs. workload orchestration) before attempting a full system prototype.
   - Several teams, including Red Hat and others, offered resources, such as test environments, to help accelerate prototyping.

* Test and Compliance Framework:
   - A need to define what compliance looks like for the project and how a test suite will be developed and maintained over time.
   - Initial thoughts on having different compliance suites for device vendors and app developers were shared, but further work is needed to detail this process and ensure long-term sustainability.
   - This topic was also discussed at the App Package meeting on Sept. 4, where the LF Program Management team provided some preliminary points of consideration and examples.

**Potential Action Items**
* Task List for Adjustments: 
   - Create a task list for volunteers to address gaps identified in the project, focusing on refining processes and improving outcomes. This includes potential adjustments to the project deliverables and accelerating certain activities.
* Focus Group on Kubernetes Variants:
   - Form a working group to address the challenges of managing different Kubernetes distributions in an industrial context and explore solutions like abstraction layers or using existing open-source frameworks.
* End-User Involvement Strategy:
   - Develop a plan to involve end users more actively, possibly through advisory boards or focus groups, ensuring that the deliverables are aligned with customer needs.
* Refinement of Key Terminology:
   - Work on clarifying and standardizing terminology, particularly around "orchestration" and "management." Ensure that this is reflected in both technical documentation and external communications.
* Interim Deliverables:
   - Focus on delivering specific, vertical slices of the overall Margo vision, such as a reference implementation for a particular use case, to demonstrate tangible progress within the next quarter.
* Prototype and Code-First Working Group:
   - Volunteers: Armand Craig, Philip Presson, and others will explore a focused approach to building prototypes that address specific problems (e.g., device and workload orchestration).
   - Action: Develop smaller, focused prototypes and ensure clear documentation on their goals and expected outcomes.
* Decision Framework Documentation:
   - A subgroup led by Shawn Mcilroy (Linux Foundation), Phil, and Armand will work on creating a clear decision-making process, focusing on collecting feedback, handling contributions asynchronously, and defining timelines for decisions.
* Test and Compliance Suite:
   - Further discussions needed on defining compliance criteria and developing a test suite. The challenge of maintaining this test suite over time was acknowledged, and more resources may be required to address this.
* Red Hat Lab Resources:
   - Kelly Switt offered the use of Red Hat’s open lab environment in Houston for prototyping and testing. Follow-up discussions are needed to see how the community can leverage this resource.
