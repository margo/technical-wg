### Minutes
The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings. The topics covered included: 

* Principles of Margo Device Management:
   - Prioritization of making devices Margo compliant from day zero.
   - Transformation of brownfield devices into Margo compliant ones is a secondary priority.
   - Ensuring interoperability within device management and workload management.
* Levels of Device Management:
   - Proposal of tiers or levels of device management.
   - Tier 1: Proprietary device management interface with workload orchestration agent enabled.
   - Tier 2: Support for both workload and device orchestration interfaces.
* Management Workflows and Functions:
   - Assigning resources for workloads.
   - Configuring device runtime.
   - Updating firmware and onboarding devices to orchestration services.
   - Consideration of cybersecurity aspects, including managing certificates and ensuring trust between devices and orchestration services.
   - Potential need for time synchronization and other security-related services.
* Discussion Points and Challenges:
   - Differentiating between configuration and discovery of device capabilities.
   - Handling of open telemetry configurations and whether this responsibility lies with device orchestration or workload orchestration agents.
   - Ensuring necessary functionalities on devices irrespective of whether they use proprietary or Margo interfaces.
   - Trust establishment and identity management during device onboarding.
   - Replacement and decommissioning of devices, including transferring devices between management services.

**Open Items**
   - Define the exact requirements for configuring device runtimes.
   - Break down onboarding processes, including trust establishment and identity management.
   - Detail management workflows, particularly around firmware updates and workload orchestration.
   - Clarify the responsibilities and interfaces for both proprietary and Margo-compliant device management.
   - Establish working groups to focus on specific aspects of device management within Margo.
