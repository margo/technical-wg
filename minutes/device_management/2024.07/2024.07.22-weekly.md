### Minutes
The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings. The topics covered included: 

* Unique Device Identification:
   - Discussion on the importance and methods of creating a unique identifier for devices.
   - Options for engraving a unique number or providing a link to a unique number on the device.
   - Emphasis on the need for the identifier to be available during the onboarding process.
* Onboarding Process:
   - The onboarding process should ensure the unique identifier is trusted and available.
   - The identifier can be provided either by the vendor or device management software.
   - Consideration of devices with multiple identifiers (physical and software levels) and the need for a single unique identifier for the workload.
* Security Implications:
   - Trust in the device is crucial, and the onboarding process must establish a trust relationship with the workload orchestrator.
   - The device must maintain this trust relationship throughout its operational lifecycle.
   - Possible methods for maintaining trust include key exchange and periodic re-establishment of trust.
* Operational Considerations:
   - The importance of re-establishing trust periodically or upon certain events (e.g., device restart).
   - Flexibility in the security mechanism to cater to various use cases without being overly restrictive.

**Open Items:**
   - Document the discussed points regarding unique device identification, onboarding processes, and security implications.
   - Write detailed functional requirements based on the discussion.
   - Put together a draft that captures the key points and requirements from the discussion.
   - Schedule a review of the draft to identify next steps and further refine the requirements.
   - After reviewing the draft, plan subsequent actions and ensure the onboarding and security processes are clearly defined and implementable.
   - Develop mechanisms for periodic re-establishment of trust, potentially through API calls or other security protocols.
