### Minutes
The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev. The discussion broadly covered: 

* Otel Collector Location:
   - Discussion on the necessity of having the otel collector on the leader node.
   - Agreement that while the collector should be on the leader, it's more of a recommendation rather than a strict requirement, as long as the working node can reach the collector on the leader.

* Docker Compose and Helm:
   - Clarification on whether standalone devices must support deploying applications using Docker Compose.
   - Agreement that the requirement should be written in a way that supports multiple Docker Compose files.
   - Discussion on specifying versions for Helm and Docker Compose to ensure compatibility.

* Single Vendor Cluster:
   - It was suggested to explicitly state that only single vendor clusters are supported in Margo version one.
   - Agreement to avoid specifying Kubernetes distributions but to ensure that any production-level distribution of Kubernetes will allow Helm chart deployments.

* Policy Agent and Device Requirements:
   - Brief mention of the importance of policy agents and device requirements.
   - Noted that there is still work to be done on version management and compatibility between different Kubernetes and Helm versions.

* Future Focus Areas:
   - Identified the need for more work on device enrollment, updates, and orchestration.
   - Acknowledged that while there are currently no volunteers for certain focus areas, it's crucial to keep these in mind for future efforts.

**Open Items**:
- Merrill to follow up with Jory Burson on the CLA setup process.
- Review and align the document structure and requirements with the provided templates and guidelines.
- Ensure that the note about only supporting single vendor clusters is clearly stated in the document.
