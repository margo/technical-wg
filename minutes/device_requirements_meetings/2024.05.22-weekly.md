### Minutes
The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev. The discussion broadly covered: 

* Device Roles and Categories:
   - **Leader Role**: Functions as the Kubernetes master.
   - **Worker Role**: Devices that can only act as workers due to resource limitations.
   - **Standalone Cluster Role**: Docker compose-based devices.

* Requirements and Challenges:
   - Defining base-level requirements for devices, especially for TPM, secure boot, attestation, and zero trust.
   - Managing the versioning and distribution of Kubernetes, considering the rapid development cycle of Kubernetes, which changes every six months.
   - Ensuring compatibility between leader and worker nodes, especially when different vendors are involved.

* Compatibility and Standardization:
   - There needs to be a clear definition of compatibility parameters to ensure interoperability between devices from different vendors.
   - The discussion highlighted the importance of having consistent versions and distributions of Kubernetes across devices from multiple vendors.

* Leaf Devices and Micro Devices:
   - These are smaller devices that might not fit into the traditional roles of leader or worker but still need to be part of the ecosystem.
   - Leaf devices need to be connected to a cluster but are not part of it, differing from standalone devices that operate independently.

* Long-term Goals:
   - The ultimate goal is to achieve multi-vendor clusters, though the initial focus may be on single-vendor clusters to simplify initial implementation.
   - There is a need to start engaging with other open-source projects and vendors to address the challenges related to multi-vendor cluster support.

**Open Items**

   - Establish what attributes and parameters are necessary to define compatibility between devices from different vendors.
   - Explicitly state whether multi-vendor cluster support will be part of V1.
   - Document the roadmap, making it clear that the long-term goal includes multi-vendor clusters.
   - Begin discussions with relevant open-source projects (e.g., Kubernetes) and vendors to understand and address interoperability challenges.
   - Develop a strategy for managing the lifecycle of devices, including updates and version control.
   - Ensure that the initial scope covers the interactions and compatibility requirements for single-vendor clusters, setting the foundation for future multi-vendor support.
   - Maintain clear and transparent documentation of decisions, roadmaps, and ongoing work to ensure all stakeholders are informed and aligned.
   - Define the roles and integration points for leaf and micro devices within the cluster ecosystem.
   - Determine how these devices will interact with the existing roles and workload orchestration systems.
