### Minutes
The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings. The topics covered included: 

* Purpose of the Meeting:
   - Discuss device management requirements within the Margo framework.
   - Focus on defining high-level buckets and deriving detailed requirements from these discussions.

* Device Orchestration Agent:
   - Responsibilities include communication with device orchestration software, onboarding, receiving updates, and applying configurations.
   - Debate on whether this agent should be a separate entity or integrated with existing services.

* Information and Configuration:
   - Differentiating between collecting information and configuring devices.
   - Importance of defining interfaces for managing devices without dictating the implementation details.

* Greenfield vs. Brownfield Scenarios:
   - Greenfield: New devices manufactured to be Margo compliant from the start.
   - Brownfield: Existing devices in the field that need to be updated to Margo compliance.
   - Acknowledgment of the complexity of Brownfield scenarios and the potential for custom engineering solutions.

* Interoperability and Standardization:
   - Need for well-defined APIs to ensure interoperability between devices and management planes from different vendors.
   - Discussion on the importance of maintaining implementation freedom for adopters while ensuring compliance with Margo standards.

* Device Management Focus Groups:
   - Proposal to create focus groups to discuss specific aspects of device management.
   - Emphasis on starting with high-level discussions and gradually deriving detailed requirements.

* Future Actions and Next Steps:
   - Armand Craig to send out an email with a shared folder for participants to drop topics and ideas for discussion.
   - Plan to continue discussions in the next meeting, refining and expanding on the topics covered.

**Open Items:**
   - Send out an email to participants with a shared folder for topic suggestions.
   - Draft initial thoughts and high-level buckets for device management requirements.
   - Contribute to the shared folder with topics and ideas for discussion.
   - Review and provide feedback on the proposed high-level buckets and requirements.
