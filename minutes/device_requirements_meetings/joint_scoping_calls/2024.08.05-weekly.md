### Minutes
The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings. The topics covered included: 

* Device and Workload Orchestration Integration:
   - Discussion centered around integrating device orchestration and workload orchestration, particularly focusing on the interaction between the two.
   - Emphasis on ensuring secure communication channels between devices and orchestration services.

* Security Approaches:
   - Presentation by Erik Nordmark (Eve Project) on security mechanisms and approaches for device and workload orchestration.
   - Highlighting mutual TLS and object signing for securing communications.
   - Issues faced with content inspecting proxies and solutions involving multi-layer security architectures.

* Deployment Models:
   - Differences in deployment models, particularly between enterprise-managed and cloud-managed orchestration services.
   - Considerations for on-premises deployments and their unique security challenges.

* Focus Group Work and Requirements:
   - Ongoing work in the Margo project, focusing on defining requirements for device and workload orchestration interfaces.
   - Need to be prescriptive in setting security and communication standards to ensure compatibility and ease of deployment.

* Community Contributions and Insights:
   - Contributions from different members, including experiences and strategies from the CNCF WasmCloud project.
   - Discussions on how existing open-source projects and their learnings can be integrated into Margo.

**Open Items**
   - Armand Craig to continue drafting documents detailing the requirements and standards for device and workload orchestration interfaces.
   - Include insights from Erik’s presentation on security architectures.
   - Bailey Hayes to potentially present a detailed walkthrough of the CNCF WasmCloud project’s approach to workload identity and security in the next month.
   - Follow-up discussion on different deployment models and their specific security needs.
   - Jory Burson to clean up existing Discord channels and set up a dedicated private channel for device management discussions. Standing Monday call to be discontinued.
   - Ensure the new channel is easily discoverable for new members.
   - Erik Nordmark and Armand Craig to further explore the secure binding between device and workload orchestration, especially focusing on node-locking and certificate management.
   - Encourage members to share their experiences and deployment scenarios, particularly focusing on ISA 95 architectures and proxy implementations in enterprise environments.
