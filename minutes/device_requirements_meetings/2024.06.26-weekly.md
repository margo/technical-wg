### Minutes
The call was recorded and is available to Members at [https://openprofile.dev](https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings). The discussion broadly covered: 

* Redfish Standard Overview:
   - Johan Tegnell presented an overview of the Redfish standard, its development by the DMTF (Distributed Management Task Force), and its applications.
   - Redfish is designed for simple and secure management of hardware and software, utilizing JSON data format and HTTPS protocol.
   - Key features include platform independence, extensive predefined data models, scalability, extensibility, and security.
* Redfish in Comparison to Other Standards:
   - Discussion on Redfish vs. MQTT, highlighting Redfish’s built-in semantics and data modeling advantages.
   - Mention of Redfish’s history of being used at the BIOS level and its evolution to support OS-level runtime applications.
* Integration with Other Systems:
   - Integration of Redfish with OTEL for monitoring containerized applications.
   - Discussion on the potential overlap between Redfish and OTEL, especially regarding data collection and telemetry.
   - Consideration of how Redfish data might be translated or integrated into OTEL’s structure.
* Implementation Challenges and Considerations:
   - The complexity of implementing Redfish and OTEL together without duplicating infrastructure.
   - Discussion on the specifics of querying Redfish data and establishing connections for data retrieval, particularly in cloud environments.
   - The necessity for a clear division of responsibilities between device and workload orchestration systems.
* OPAF and Redfish:**
   - The Open Process Automation Forum (OPAF) has centered its specifications around Redfish.
   - The potential need to reconcile OPAF’s use of Redfish with the Margo project’s goals to ensure compatibility and avoid market fragmentation.

**Open Items:**

   - Johan Tegnell and SE team to investigate deeper integration possibilities between Redfish and OTEL.
   - Clarify the dividing lines and responsibilities between Redfish and OTEL within device and workload orchestration.
   - Participants to discuss internally the potential adoption of Redfish for future devices and the implications for ongoing projects.
   - Define the minimum set of data required for device and workload orchestration and determine how Redfish and OTEL can be utilized to collect and manage this data efficiently.
   - Communicate with the Open Process Automation Forum (OPAF) to understand their stance on OTEL and ensure alignment with the Margo project.
   - Schedule follow-up meetings to continue discussions on Redfish integration and address any emerging issues or findings.
   - Explore the use of Redfish’s event and telemetry functions for alert management and unsolicited updates.
