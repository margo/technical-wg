## Margo Device Requirements Focus Group Meeting - 05 June 2024

### Attendees:
* Armand Craig (Rockwell Automation)
* Bart Nieuwborg (Rockwell Automation)
* Christian Storm (Siemens)
* Erik Nordmark (ZEDADA)
* Himanshu Singh (Capgemini)
* Julien Duquesnay (Schneider Electric)
* Merrill Harriman (Schneider Electric) - Chair
* Philip Presson (ABB)

### Minutes
The call was recorded and is available to Members at [https://openprofile.dev](https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings). The discussion broadly covered: 

* Device and Cluster Requirements:
   - Emphasis on the functional requirements for standalone devices and cluster leaders.
   - Discussion on the necessity of having a dedicated OTEL collector on devices versus using a proxy setup.

* OTEL Collector Placement:
   - Debate on whether the collector must be on the device or can be proxied to another device.
   - Agreement that a collector must be present on the device but the potential for proxy configurations should be considered, though it may not be a priority for version one.

* Telemetry and Observability Data:
   - Differentiation between device observability data and application observability data.
   - Mention of the need for a structured approach to capture and manage telemetry data.

* Performance and Resource Utilization:
   - Concerns about the performance impact of running OTEL collectors on the device.
   - Consideration of offloading the collector to free up device resources.

* Use Case Alignment:
   - Importance of aligning mandatory requirements with defined use cases for version one.
   - Ensuring that requirements support the use cases without overwhelming the initial release.

**Open Items**

   - Investigate the feasibility and performance implications of using a proxy OTEL collector.
   - Ensure configurations align with the open telemetry specifications.
   - Expand and detail the functional requirements for cluster leaders, focusing on telemetry, collection, and aggregation.
   - Review and align requirements with the version one use cases.
   - Define and document what will be mandatory for version one versus future releases.
   - Continue building out the documentation for device and cluster requirements.
   - Solicit feedback from team members to ensure comprehensive coverage of all necessary areas.
   - Assess resource requirements for running OTEL collectors and potential benefits of proxy configurations.
   - Determine if additional investigation is needed for performance testing and validation.
