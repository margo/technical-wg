### Minutes

The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings. The discussion topics included: 

* Conformance Tests and Compliance Program:
   - The group discussed setting up conformance tests and building a compliance program for Margo.
   - David Woolf (Linux Foundation) was introduced to assist with conformance program development.
   - The conversation focused on defining the goals of the test program, ensuring interoperability, and protecting the brand.
   - Different test programs were discussed, including verifying the message formats, interoperability of devices, and behavioral conformance of components.
   - Discussions included the need for a test specification to ensure consistent implementation and testing.

* Local Registries:
   - The team reviewed the concept of local registries for docker images and helm charts to handle different device connectivity scenarios:
     - Fully connected devices (with internet access).
     - Locally connected devices (limited to a local network).
     - Air-gapped devices (completely isolated, requiring manual updates).
   - Several technical options for setting up local registries were explored, including Kubernetes-level registry mirrors, Docker pull-through caches, and Helm chart repositories.
   - There was discussion on whether these registries should be part of the official specification or supporting materials.

* Security and Compliance Concerns:
   - The team raised the importance of ensuring security for applications and components.
   - Considerations around registry authentication, credential management, and ensuring secure image deployment were discussed.
   - The group also explored the idea of using SHA-256 checksums to verify the integrity of application images.

**Action Items:**
* Conformance Test Program:
   - Each focus group should outline their respective test specifications.
   - Linux Foundation team to provide examples of test specifications and tooling for compliance programs.
   - Armand Craig to schedule follow-up meetings to break down the tasks related to test and compliance specifications.
* Local Registry Definitions:
   - Arne Bröring to review whether local registry definitions should be part of the core Margo specification or a separate descriptive document.
   - A further discussion is needed to decide if the registry setup should fall under the orchestration or app interoperability categories.
* Credential Management:
   - The group needs to investigate integrating credential management into the deployment process, specifically for registry access.
   - A task force may be needed to define best practices for handling authentication and secret management in line with existing industry practices.
* Follow-up on Security Discussions:
   - Armand Craig to initiate discussions on integrating security aspects like SHA-256 checksums into the deployment process.
   - Further conversation on how the spec should handle registry credential management and ensure secure access to applications.
