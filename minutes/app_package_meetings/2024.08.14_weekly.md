### Minutes

The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings. The discussion covered: 

* New Member Introductions:
   - A discussion area has been created in the technical working group section for new members to introduce themselves. Moving this introduction process to Discord is being considered for easier communication and less technical overhead.

* Device Orchestration Discussions:
   - Introduction of a forum channel in Discord for ongoing discussions related to device orchestration, device management, and observability requirements.

* Helm Charts and Deployment Strategies:**
   - Continued exploration of deployment strategies from the edge, focusing on pulling Helm charts, Docker container images, and other resources from various registries.
   - Key proposal: Flexibility in the registry source (user-controlled, vendor-controlled, or workload orchestration solution-controlled).

* Application Dependency Management:
   - Discussed handling dependencies and ensuring configurable registry locations for dependent charts in Helm. Concerns were raised about ensuring that application dependencies remain intact even if registry locations change.

* Security Concerns:
   - Ensuring the security and integrity of Helm charts, Docker images, and YAML files during deployment is a major concern.
   - Ongoing discussions about implementing signing mechanisms and verifying chart authenticity.
   - Concerns about potential vulnerabilities if end-users modify deployment configurations.

* User vs. Developer Trust in Modifications:
   - Debate on whether users should be allowed to modify Helm charts or other configurations. The potential impacts on application integrity and supportability if users make unauthorized changes were discussed.

* Device Capabilities and Kubernetes Integration:
   - Discussion on integrating node feature discovery to detect device capabilities and optimize application placement in Kubernetes clusters.

**Open Items:**
* Move New Member Introductions to Discord
* Security and Signature Implementation:**
   - Further research needed on the existing methods for signing Helm charts and verifying Docker images.
   - Julien Duquesnay and Russel Callen will look into current best practices and potential solutions for securing artifacts.
