Arne led the call, which covered the following topics:

* Application Description Updates: The discussion focused on proposed changes to the application description format, specifically around the inclusion and handling of Docker Compose files and Helm charts. Different approaches to structuring and validating these components within the Margo framework were considered, including security implications and deployment considerations.

* Security and Compliance Concerns: Security was a recurring theme, particularly how to handle security validations for third-party tools and applications integrated via Helm charts or Docker Compose files. The conversation touched on the need for a strategy to handle credentials and ensure compliance with Margo’s security requirements.

* General Margo Tooling and Infrastructure: The group discussed using the project board as well as issue templates and other GitHub automation convienences to manage the group's workload. Armand noted that he and Christian were working on improving this tooling. Jory will investigate how to unblock anyone who is currently blocked by EasyCLA.
