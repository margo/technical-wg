## Summary Meeting Notes
The team discussed finalizing the application package definition, focusing on the removal of the Margo.yaml file requirement due to confusion. The application description is now defined as a Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD) of kind application description. The need for clarity on whether the file is a Kubernetes CRD was debated, with a consensus to clarify this in the documentation. Issues such as non-root containers, app trust, and Docker Compose versioning were also addressed, with plans to move some to future security focus groups. The team agreed to restructure the specification document to better separate informative text from formal definitions.

**Finalizing Application Package Definition**
Arne introduces the meeting and the focus on finalizing the application package definition.
Arne mentions a pull request he created to address some issues and invites discussion.
Arne explains the confusion with Margo.yaml file and the decision to remove this requirement.
Segev seeks clarification on the file type, and Arne confirms the change to a Kubernetes custom resource definition (CRD) for the application description.

**Clarifying Kubernetes CRD Reference**
Silvano raises questions about the necessity of a Kubernetes reference, while Arne elaborates on the existing structure. Phil points out that the application description file isn't a formal Custom Resource Definition (CRD), though it has some similarities. Silvano proposes adding a note to clarify the file's status, and Arne concurs. Meanwhile, Armand and Phil emphasize the importance of not binding the YAML to a particular Kubernetes version.

**Addressing Technical Lexicon and Terminology**
Arne talks about adding a sequence diagram, which was later removed based on feedback. He responds to Savannah's remarks about terms such as "application registry" and "application catalog" and their relevance to the technical vocabulary. Arne intends to submit a PR that incorporates these terms alongside anchor links to their definitions. Meanwhile, Armand highlights the significance of the technical vocabulary for different teams and recommends proceeding with the existing PR.

**Reviewing and Approving the Pull Request**
Arne seeks feedback on the pull request and mentions Phil's support. Armand agrees to review the PR and recommends proceeding despite pending updates. If there are no further comments, Arne plans to merge the PR. Arne and Armand discuss the need for consistent examples and emphasize the value of a preview release.

**Discussion on Application Endpoint Discovery**
Phil raises a new concern regarding workload vendors revealing application endpoints. He outlines the necessity of documenting proposals to record solutions and encourage dialogue. Arne and Phil deliberate on where to place this issue in the problem statement template. Phil stresses the significance of documenting proposals to keep track of decisions and their justifications.

**Addressing Non-Root Containers and App Trust Issues**
Merrill addresses the challenge of non-root containers and emphasizes the necessity to intercept Docker Compose files executed as root. Armand recommends transferring this discussion to the security focus group. Merrill and others explore the ramifications of eliminating the version attribute from Docker Compose files. Stephen B and Julien confirm that while the version attribute in the file is outdated, the specification version remains significant.

**Clarifying Docker Compose Versioning**
Merrill and others examine the deletion of the version attribute and its effects on backward compatibility. Silvano raises concerns regarding APIs lacking versioning. Arne proposes that Merrill and the team delve deeper and clarify the consequences. The group consents to keep the discussion ongoing in future meetings.

**Structuring the Specification Document**
Arne suggests reorganizing the specification document to distinguish between descriptive text and formal definitions. Armand notes a forthcoming proposal to revise the document in response to contributor feedback. The team emphasizes the need to enhance the document's navigability for contributors. Arne wraps up the meeting by expressing gratitude for everyone’s input and indicating that they will carry the discussion forward in the next meeting.
