**Arnie opens the meeting at 14:00 GMT**

**Key Discussion Points:**

**Product Management Task:**
Armand announced a new product management task (number 14) that impacts two personas: app dev and device provider.    
The task involves enabling the matching of workloads with compatible devices.    
Armand moved the child epic into the workload orchestration agent project.    
Phil's spec number seven updates on the app description format need to be linked to this child epic.    
The requirements for the child epic are considered fairly simple.    
Device Capabilities and Application Requirements:

**Device Capabilities and Application Requirements:**
The discussion from a previous meeting about defining device capabilities was revisited.    
The group acknowledged that the device capabilities spec is in JSON format with tables.    
There were challenges in matching device capabilities with Helm or OCI container specs for resource requests and limits.    
The group needs to determine how detailed the app package definition needs to be.    
A basic version of matching could include CPU cores and available RAM.    
The primary goal is to enable the fleet manager to filter compatible devices based on application requirements.    
Technical Challenges and Solutions for Resource Representation:

**Technical Challenges and Solutions for Resource Representation:**
Carl Moberg explained the complexities of resource placement and the need to separate resource claims from resource descriptions.    
The group discussed whether the fleet manager should ingest Helm charts and unpack them to inspect container specifications.    
There is no industry-wide accepted abstraction of resource representation for Linux hosts.    
Data sources like the kernel, U dev database, and running services are clear, but the format for communicating this data to upper layers is not standardized.    
Christian Storm suggested that the Asset Administration Shell could be a promising solution due to its flexibility and extensibility.    
The group agreed that Margo should focus on higher-level abstractions and utilize existing tools to manage the complexities of device information.    
Application Deployment and Device Discovery:

**Application Deployment and Device Discovery:**
The discussion clarified that device capability reporting should be dynamic, with devices reporting their capabilities to the workload fleet manager.    
The group acknowledged the need to assign an owner to the task and to link it to a spec for management as a feature.    
Terminology and Definitions:

**Terminology and Definitions:**
Arne raised concerns about the disconnect between the application package definition and the use of the term "workload" in the specification.    
The group discussed the terminology used in Kubernetes and Compose, where "application" and "workload" have specific meanings.    
There was a proposal to rename "workload artifact," but there were concerns about changing terminology and creating confusion.    
The group discussed whether to use "component" or "workload" and the implications of aligning with existing terminology.    
Ultimately, the decision was to stick with "component" in the application description document.    
Pull Request and Specification Finalization:

**Pull Request and Specification Finalization:**
Sylvana agreed to update the pull request to reflect the decision on terminology.    
Armand cautioned against adhering strictly to the July deadline for finalization due to the lack of clear requirements and workload distribution.    

**Action Items:**
- Arne to finalize the package definition specification.    
- Sylvana to update the pull request with the agreed-upon terminology.    
- Armand to provide Karthik with access by getting his GitHub handle.
