## Attendees

### Summary Meeting Notes
Arne presented a proof of concept for an app loader based on the latest specification draft, demonstrating how it loads and configures application descriptions. The loader creates an application deployment file, which can be integrated with the work fleet manager. Armand praised the presentation and suggested combining the loader into the Margo community repository. Arne discussed finalizing the specification, including terminology clarifications and changes from "Docker Compose" to "Compose." Liam mentioned progress on the updated home chart for WASM. Bart emphasized the importance of the preview release one and the need for precise product management requirements by mid-March, with a product owner to be hired to refine these.

### Minutes
**Application Package Definition Focus Group Introduction**
Arne welcomes all attendees to the focus group meeting on app package definition. He verifies that everyone can hear and see the screen. Next, he presents the agenda and emphasizes the importance of discussing the reference implementation. Arne subsequently opens the latest specification draft, explaining the workflow pertinent to the application package definition.

**Overview of Application Package Definition Workflow**
Arne describes a process whereby an end user interacts with the work fleet manager's front end or application catalogue. The workload fleet manager retrieves application descriptions from established registries or a cache. The end user configures the application according to its description and develops an application deployment definition. Arne presents a proof of concept app loader that imports an application description YAML file and generates an application deployment file.

**Proof of Concept App Loader Demonstration**
Arne showcases the app loader, illustrating how it generates an instance of the application description class. The app loader reveals the details from the application description file, encompassing metadata such as API version, app ID, name, and description. He discusses selecting a deployment profile and input values for necessary parameters. Following this, the app loader produces the application deployment file, which can be uploaded or used to establish the desired state.

**Feedback and Integration of App Loader**
Armand notes its importance for the forthcoming discussion. He proposes adding the app loader to the Margo community repository. Arne consents to submitting the app loader to their group's dedicated repository. Armand urges Arne to acknowledge his contributions to the reference implementation effort.

**Finalizing the Specification and Terminology Clarification**
Arne emphasizes the importance of finalizing the specifications and clarifying the technical terminology. He elaborates on the definitions of "application" and "workload," explaining their roles in the specification. Armand notes the upcoming pre-draft pull request and emphasizes the necessity for feedback before merging. Additionally, Arne points out the need to replace "Docker Compose" with "Compose" to eliminate any Docker dependency.

**Updates on Open Issues and Contributions**
Arne brings up Liam's update regarding the revised home chart and his intention to submit it shortly. Liam addresses the difficulties of linking the Margo specification to the Wasm cloud and overseeing WebAssembly components. Armand proposes initiating a PR on the pre-draft branch after Thursday to incorporate the most recent updates. Arne inquires with Phil about the status of exposing application endpoints, to which Phil replies that there are no new proposals at this time.

**Application Endpoint Discovery and Preview Release Planning**
Arne requests an update from Deepak regarding application endpoint discovery, to which Deepak responds that he is still investigating. Armand gives an update about the preview release and emphasizes the necessity for priority from the PMG. Bart affirms the PMG's intention to proceed with preview release one, highlighting the significance of defining the app package. Additionally, Bart notes that a product owner will soon be hired to assist in refining product management requirements.

**Product Management Requirements and Future Plans**
Bart explains the process of writing product management requirements and the product owner's responsibilities. He underscores the importance of aligning technical efforts with these requirements. Additionally, Bart mentions bringing in a scrum team to develop a reference implementation. He reassures the team that the product management team will deliver precise requirements by the end of March.

**Closing Remarks and Next Steps**
Arne inquires about any further feedback or discussions. Armand states we must wait for the product management requirements before finalizing the specification. Bart emphasizes the significance of the preview release one and the forthcoming requirements. Arne expresses gratitude to everyone and proposes concluding the meeting early, with plans to reconvene next week.
