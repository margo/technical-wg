**Summary meeting notes**
The team discussed the integration of Helm for WASM and the creation of a new column for pre-release issues. They debated renaming the project to "Release One." Liam emphasized aligning with existing enterprise solutions for container distribution and signing. Segev demonstrated a Docker Compose workload deployment, highlighting the need for a clear strategy for handling custom artefacts like images. The team agreed to use OCI registries for artefact distribution and ensure the integrity of REST API responses. They also discussed the need for a file input type in the Margot YAML and the importance of validating custom artifacts.

**Discussion on Helm Integration and Documentation** -
Arne assesses the Helm integration and proposes adding a paragraph and an example to enhance the current text. Armand agrees and opts to keep the issue open until it can be resolved. Arne also mentions using a machine learning tool to confirm the schema's precision, citing a forthcoming pull request that will feature minor updates to the document. Additionally, Merrill points out ongoing work at Schneider regarding the app package definition, indicating its alignment with the group's projects.

**Pre-Release Issues and WASM Integration** -
Arne proposes reviewing the "In Progress" issues before the pre-release, marking Liam's arrival. Liam talks about integrating WASM via Helm, indicating that it can be approached either through an operator or native integration. He also commits to checking the Kubernetes update and documenting the integration in the designated document. Arne and Liam cover the "In Progress" column, emphasizing the Schneider issues tied to security and the assessment of Docker Compose.

**Security and Docker Compose Evaluation** -
Merrill shares updates on internal efforts concerning security issues, particularly addressing rootful containers and application signing. Additionally, Merrill highlights ongoing efforts regarding application signing and its connection to app bundles. Arne and Merrill discuss the Docker Compose evaluation, emphasizing the necessity of ensuring compatibility with both Kubernetes and Docker Compose. Armand stresses the importance of aligning with the Docker Compose evaluation and further dissecting issues based on Segev's feedback.

**App Trust and Signing Mechanisms** -
Armand explains the signing processes for app packages, encompassing containers, manifests, and Docker artifacts. Merrill adds that Dave Smith and John Philippe Facino are currently working on signing app bundles. Arne clarifies that app bundle signing will occur during the official release rather than in the pre-release phase. Meanwhile, Armand and Merrill review the objectives of the pre-release phase, emphasizing their focus on supporting Docker-enabled edge devices and defining workloads.

**Deployment Spec and Artifact Management** -
Armand and Segev talk about the deployment specifications for Docker Compose, focusing on YAML files and links to external artefacts. Phil specifies what types of artefacts need to be included in the package like Docker Compose YAML and various configuration files. Merrill proposes creating a diagram to illustrate the files at each step of the deployment process, from the app developer to the WAS and into the edge device. Armand and Segev concur on the importance of documenting the inclusion of Docker Compose YAML and other essential files in the package.

**Custom Artifacts and Validation** -
Stephen recommends validating the integrity of custom artefacts through hashes and digital signatures.
Armand points out that while Margo is not tasked with verifying custom artefacts, she does ensure the integrity of the deployment specification.
Merrill and Armand discuss aligning with current enterprise solutions for artefact management and distribution.
Liam underscores the necessity of aligning with established value chains to prevent the introduction of new complexities.

**Finalizing Specification and Next Steps** -
Arne requests final feedback on the specification text, confirming that tar balls will be used to package Docker Compose files and other essential artefacts. 
Armand consents to include an additional bullet point regarding adding custom artefacts to the workload. 
The team decides to carry on the discussion in the next meeting, prioritizing finalising the specification and tackling any unresolved matters. 
The meeting ended with an agreement on the next steps and a strategy for continuing the discussion in the upcoming session.

### Action Items
- [ ] Liam will provide a short paragraph and an example of integrating WASM using Helm.
