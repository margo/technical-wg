### Summary Meeting Notes

The meeting focused on challenges in exposing application endpoints, particularly for WASM and Kubernetes. Issues discussed included conflicts with Docker Compose and Kubernetes ingress controllers, such as port and hostname collisions. Solutions proposed included using CRDs and the Gateway API to automate configuration and avoid naming conflicts. Liam emphasized the importance of unique identifiers and automation to manage these conflicts. The team also considered the potential benefits of the Gateway API for standardizing Helm charts and improving interoperability. Future demos and further discussions were planned to explore these solutions in detail.

### Meeting Notes

**Discussion on Exposing Application Endpoints** -
Phil initiates the meeting, explaining the purpose: discussing potential problems in exposing application endpoints, whether UI or API, on various platforms like Docker Compose, Kubernetes, and wasm.
Phil mentions issues with Docker Compose, such as multiple files trying to expose the same ports, which causes conflicts.
For Kubernetes, Phil discusses problems with ingress controllers, such as mismatched attributes and conflicts with hostnames and routes.
Phil suggests understanding the problems and proposes that people write up proposals to address these issues.

**Introduction to wasm and Its Deployment** -
Liam explains that the WASM cloud deploys on various platforms, such as Kubernetes, Fargate, ECS, Docker, and native hardware.
Liam describes the role of the Kubernetes operator in integrating with the ingress controller and abstracting complexity.
Phil asks about configuring endpoints for a UI application, and Liam explains how DNS discovery mechanisms and Istio handle certificates and port mapping.
Liam mentions the new sidecar-less service mesh and its potential benefits for 2025.

**Potential Conflicts with wasm Endpoints** -
Phil inquires if there are comparable configurations to ingress manifests or gateway APIs for wasm.
Liam explains that WASM cloud's operator handles synchronization automatically, making it easier for app vendors.
Phil and Liam discuss the possibility of conflicts with multiple app vendors defining the same routes or ports.
Joonas joins the conversation, explaining the virtual IP layer in Kubernetes and the potential for naming conflicts.

**Automation and Unique Identifiers** -
Joonas suggests using automation to handle naming conflicts and generating unique identifiers for each application.
Phil asks if this happens automatically, and Joonas confirms that WASM cloud's operator handles configuration automatically.
Phil proposes a future call to demonstrate how CRDs and operators work in WASM.
Joonas mentions the flexibility of using both gateway API and Ingress API, depending on the device's capabilities.

**Gateway API and Helm Charts** -
Armand raises concerns about defining applications once and the challenges with annotations in Helm charts.
Joonas explains the gateway API's intention to provide a consistent experience across different environments.
Armand suggests that the gateway API could help with interoperability and environment variables.
Phil and Armand discuss the balance between new features and the strain on app devs.

**Demos and Future Discussions** -
Liam offers to demonstrate deployments and polyglot composition with wasm and Kubernetes.
Armand mentions a current issue with Red Hat and OpenShift ingesting Helm charts in the orchestrator instead of the edge.
Phil requests Liam to highlight potential problems with WASM and propose solutions.
The meeting concludes with a plan to update issues and discuss solutions in the next call.

### Action Items
- [ ] Liam or the WASM cloud team to provide a demo or walkthrough on how WASM cloud defines CRDs and how that gets translated to Kubernetes resources like Ingress or Gateway API.
- [ ] Liam or the WASM cloud team to share a demo or example of auto-scaling across a large Kubernetes footprint in the cloud, or a demo showing polyglot composition of the same workload implemented in different languages.
- [ ] Update the "Potential Problems Exposing Application Endpoints" document to include information about WASM-specific considerations.
