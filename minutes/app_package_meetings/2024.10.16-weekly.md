### Summary Notes

The team discussed several key issues in the Margo app package definition. Sega is working on Docker Compose evaluation, with implementation starting soon. Liam provided an update on Wasm integration in Margo YAML, awaiting feedback and documentation placement. David from Schneider discussed app trust, suggesting Notary v2 for signing Docker Compose files, aligning with Helm's PGP mechanism. Armand and Arnie emphasized the need to define required resources and device capabilities, considering node feature discovery and Kubernetes labels. Deepak raised the issue of endpoint discovery, suggesting it be addressed in the Margo YAML format. The team agreed to follow up on these points in future meetings.

### Minutes
**Docker Compose Evaluation and Wasm Integration**
Arnie initiates the meeting and asks for updates on the Docker Compose evaluation. Miguel Angelo from Schneider admits he hasn't checked with Mary Lorsiger since last week.
Armand mentions that Sega is working on defining the technical requirements and planning the proof of concept. Liam provides an update on Wasm integration in Margo YAML, mentioning he emailed Armand for feedback and is waiting for Craig's response.
Armand agrees to review the email and discuss the documentation process.

**App Trust and Non-Root Container Updates**—Arnie wants updates on app trust, which is now managed by David.
Miguel Angelo and Armand are unable to provide updates due to a lack of recent communication with Meryl.
Arnie suggests pinging Meryl for an update on the non-root container issue. Armand and Miguel Angelo agree to follow up with Meryl for more information.

**Node Feature Discovery and Application Description Format**
Armand discusses the node feature discovery process, explaining how it updates labels on Kubernetes nodes based on hardware attributes.
Armand provides an example of NVIDIA GPU labels and their implementation in the NFD. Arnie and Armand discuss the potential impact of node feature discovery on application deployment and scheduling.
Tom Counihan suggests adding a key-value pair in the Margo YAML file to reflect device capabilities, which could prevent erroneous deployments.
Armand agrees and emphasizes the need for a unified approach to describe required resources in the application description format.

**Device Capabilities and Node Feature Discovery Matching**
Armand and Arnie discuss matching the device capabilities with the node feature discovery labels. Armand suggests using key-value pairs for device capabilities and matching them with the Margo YAML format. Zack raises a concern about handling multiple devices with the same identifier, and Armand acknowledges the need for tagging nodes with specific capabilities.
Arnie and Armand agree to close the issue by matching the current design with the device side and elevating the progress to a PR for feedback.

**Endpoint Discovery and Service Mesh**
Deepak raises a question about endpoint discovery for applications deployed using Margo YAML.
Liam suggests that the WAS definition should explicitly expose availability, and Armand agrees that it's a relevant topic.
Deepak mentions that in telco edge computing, API interfaces are used for endpoint discovery, and Armand acknowledges the need to consider this in the Margo YAML format.
Arnie has assigned Deepak to follow up on this issue and present suggestions at the next meeting.

**App Trust Update and Notary v2 Signing**
David Smith provides an update on app trust, mentioning that Notary v2 can be used to sign the Docker Compose file and additional resources.
David explains that Notary v2 supports adding signature artifacts, allowing multiple signatures and flexibility in signing.
Stephen asks about the flexibility of Notary v2.0 in signing packages, and David confirms that it allows weak and strong references.
Armand and Arnie thanked David for the update and suggested using the issue tracker to present more concrete plans at the next meeting.

### Action Items
- [ ] Armand will provide feedback on the WASM integration approach document Liam sent.
- [ ] Armand to check with Meryl on the status of the non-root container work.
- [ ] David will follow up with the team on the app trust signing investigation and provide an update.
- [ ] Deepak to further flesh out the discussion on application endpoint discovery and present suggestions.
