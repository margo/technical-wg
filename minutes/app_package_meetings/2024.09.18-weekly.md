### Minutes

The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings. The discussion topics included: 

* WebAssembly (Wasm) Integration with Margo:
   - The group discussed the current application definition structure within Margo and its compatibility with WebAssembly (Wasm) modules.
   - Emphasis was placed on the integration of Wasm within existing deployment profiles, specifically through Docker Compose and Helm charts.

* Deployment Profiles for Wasm:
   - The feasibility of extending Margo's application definition to support Wasm as a first-class citizen was explored.
   - It was considered whether to create a separate deployment type for Wasm or continue using existing Helm and Docker Compose structures.

* Application Packaging and Deployment:
   - Arne presented the Margo.yaml file structure, explaining how Docker Compose and Helm charts are currently used to define deployment profiles.
   - The discussion centered around whether modifications are necessary for Margo to directly support Wasm modules or if existing structures suffice.

* Standardization and Best Practices:
   - Stephen Berard emphasized the need for a standard way to describe and deploy Wasm modules, noting that Adam and Wasm Cloud have similar goals but for different device classes.
   - Liam Randall suggested considering Wasm as a separate deployment type within Margo, citing its unique properties and orchestration requirements.

* Constrained Devices and Wasm:
   - The challenges of deploying Wasm on constrained devices without standard Docker or Helm capabilities were discussed.
   - There was a consensus on the need for a specific deployment type to cater to constrained devices, potentially using Adam’s model.

**Open Items:**
   - Further investigation into the requirements for integrating Wasm directly within Margo’s deployment profiles.
   - Consideration of a separate Wasm deployment type for more flexible orchestration.
   - Engage with the wider community, particularly those working with constrained devices, to understand real-world needs and co-develop solutions.
   - Review existing Margo documentation to identify areas where Wasm-specific information could be added or clarified.
   - Schedule a follow-up discussion to review progress and finalize the decision on whether to integrate Wasm as a new deployment type or enhance existing methods.
