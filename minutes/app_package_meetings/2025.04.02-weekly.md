### Summary Meeting Minutes

The team discussed the App Package Board for the premier release, focusing on finalizing the app package definition and addressing support for WASM. They debated the complexity of documenting device capabilities and application requirements, emphasizing the need for a simple, standardized approach. The conversation highlighted the importance of defining resource limits to prevent resource conflicts in a multi-vendor environment. They considered using Kubernetes as a model for resource representation but agreed on a simpler, more abstract format. The goal is to ensure apps can run on any Margo-compliant device, with a focus on initial release requirements and future scalability.

### Action Items
- [ ] Review the PR that Savannah has put together and provide feedback.
- [ ] Propose a way to make progress on the discussion around how resources are indicated or defined or provided, such as converting it to a problem statement or taking a more code-first approach.
- [ ] Capture use cases and general requirements from application developers, not just device/software vendors.
- [ ] Determine the scope and level of detail required for the preview release one, versus the full first release, in terms of the resource definition problem.

### Minutes

**App Package Board and PR Updates**
Phil discusses the app package board for the premier release, noting that some items remain open. He highlights a PR by Savannah and mentions Armand's updates on terms from a previous significant PR. Also, Phil asks if anyone wants to review a draft PR concerning WASM support, assuming ongoing comments from contributors.

**Clarifying Documentation and Resource Definitions**
Armand acknowledges that the clarity in the documentation is commendable but advises against overwhelming individuals with excessive information. Phil highlights the necessity of defining resources from device and application perspectives, highlighting their interconnectedness. He seeks input on how to advance the resource definition, proposing either a problem statement or a code-first approach. Armand suggests establishing a location for initial ideas and requirements, underscoring the importance of a holistic approach.

**App Vendor Representatives and Marketplace Concept**
Tom Counihan inquires whether any app vendor representatives are present. Phil acknowledges that numerous participants supply and operate applications on their devices. Tom proposes the concept of an app marketplace, to which Phil affirms that the goal is for any vendor's applications to function on any Margo-compliant device. Armand clarifies that the marketplace concept is beyond the current scope, directing attention to the app catalogue and its configuration.

**Challenges in Application Portability**
Erik emphasises that third-party application developers require both interoperability and portability. Tom Counihan highlights the necessity for application differentiation, advocating for optimisation tailored to specific instruction sets. Phil acknowledges these diverse perspectives but points out the absence of a dedicated app developer representative. In response, Armand proposes that experts within their respective organisations can assist in outlining the necessary requirements.

**Microsoft's Experience with Application Portability**
Haishi from Microsoft shares insights regarding the complexities of application portability. They propose standardising on a runtime such as Docker or employing middleware to abstract platform capabilities. Armand stresses the importance of confining the discussion to management plane requirements. He also mentions establishing a new location within the WG interfaces work group for proposals and recommends reviewing existing issues for additional context.

**Simplifying Resource Definitions for Preview Release**
Member proposes simplifying resource definitions for the initial release, concentrating on standard metrics such as CPU, RAM, and storage. Armand concurs, noting the necessity of aligning application requirements with device capabilities. Erik underscores the significance of establishing a baseline for resource definitions to provide greater clarity. Armand and Phil further deliberate the need for a simple, abstract format for these definitions, with the possibility of future expansion.

**Kubernetes Model and Device Capabilities**
A member compares the Kubernetes model for resource representation and accounting. Armand clarifies that Margo should adopt a generic language for device capabilities, translating from various standards. Erik expresses concerns about the stability and extensibility of the current tool used for generating device capabilities. Andre supports the use of Kubernetes as a model but emphasises the necessity for standard attributes for basic resources.

**Workflow for App Builders and Resource Limits**
Nilanjan inquires about the workflow for app builders, specifically whether they need to be aware of device capabilities. Armand explains that the specification should guide app developers, providing technical references that outline key-value pairs for requirements. Nilanjan further asks about limits or ranges for resource definitions, to which Armand confirms the necessity for maximum resource limits. Armand and Nilanjan then discuss the importance of including a countable attribute in resource definitions to facilitate alignment with app requirements.

**Conclusion and Next Steps**
Phil summarises the discussion, highlighting the necessity to gather general use cases and develop proposals. Armand suggests commenting on issues and establishing a location for proposals and discussions. The meeting concludes with a plan to resume discussions the following day.
