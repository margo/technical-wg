**Arne opens the meeting @ 15:00 GMT**

### Summary Meeting Notes
The team discussed updates to the application package definition specification, focusing on restructuring and content additions. Key changes include dividing the specification into three parts: overview, components, and technical reference. The terms "application" and "workload" were clarified, with "application" defined as a collection of workloads and "workload" as software tailored for specific environments. The team emphasized the need for feedback and contributions to refine the specification. They also discussed replacing references to Docker Compose with the more generic "Compose" specification and planned to submit a pull request for the restructuring branch.

**Progress Update on Specification Restructuring**
Arne begins the meeting by providing updates on the progress of the specification document's restructuring. This process included the creation of a new branch called "navigation minus content minus restructure." Armand and Philip contributed by editing the introduction page and adding personas and technical terminology. The specification is organized into three sections: overview components, technical reference, and definition of the application package.

**Discussion on Technical Terms: Application vs. Workload**
Arne outlines the suggested definitions for "application" and "workload" as discussed by Philip and Armand. Philip shares that this idea originated from a conversation with a contact at Rockwell. Armand highlights the necessity of maintaining consistent terminology within containerization and immutable fleet management frameworks. The team has agreed to keep both terms in use, acknowledging that each fulfils the specification criteria.

**Feedback and Contributions from Team Members**
Armand promotes the importance of feedback from team members, emphasizing collaboration. Merrill agrees to focus on the deployment scope rather than the details of the workload or application. Armand underlines the need for early feedback to avoid major revisions later. Phil suggests focusing on the proposed changes and addressing term discussions separately after finalizing the PR.

**Addressing Specific Issues and Next Steps**
Arne examines the items on the Kanban board, highlighting the need to integrate WASM and address the versioning issues of the Compose specification.
The team reaches a consensus to substitute mentions of Docker Compose with the broader term "Compose" specification.
Conversations regarding the application endpoints' exposure and discovery are still in progress, with no immediate updates available.
The team intends to resolve the current issues and prepare themselves for the next steps, which include submitting a pull request for the restructuring branch.

**Final Remarks and Closing of the Meeting**
Armand underscores the importance of contributions occurring between meetings to facilitate progress. Arne mentions that the group is advancing toward finalizing the pre-draft and may discontinue the calls as concerns are addressed. Armand concurs, highlighting that the PMG group will deliver further requirements to aid in finalizing the project. The meeting concludes with a reminder to review the draft branch and prepare for the upcoming steps.
