### General Meeting Notes
The meeting focused on the Docker Compose evaluation, discussing challenges such as user modification of app definitions, app vendor support, and the need for non-root containers. Key points included the importance of signing app definitions to prevent unauthorized changes, the potential for overriding certain settings, and the need for clear security requirements. The team also debated the use of ingress controllers versus load balancers for service exposure and the complexity of handling multiple applications with overlapping service requirements. The discussion highlighted the need for guidelines or custom resource definitions to manage these issues effectively.

### Minutes
**Docker Compose Evaluation and Initial Discussion** -
Merrill reports that the project is gaining traction, but it is still in the discussion phase. He highlights the challenge of determining how much user modification should be permitted in the app's definition and the implications this has for support from the app vendor. Phil and Merrill discuss the complexities of ensuring that the deployed app aligns with the app vendor's support model, as well as the potential challenges that arise from involving multiple parties.

**Modification Control and Application Vendor Relationships** -
Merrill questions how much control Margo should have over modifying different attributes in the deployment specification. Phil suggests that, ideally, certain artifacts related to the app's definition should not be modifiable; however, some elements could be allowed to be overridden. Merrill raises concerns about users wanting to adjust app settings, such as the number of cores, and emphasizes the need for the app vendor to restrict certain attributes. Phil and Merrill discuss the possibility of the app vendor enforcing specific settings and the challenges involved in determining which attributes should be modifiable.

**Signature Verification and Security Concerns** -
Phil and Merrill talk about the possibility of adding a field to the app description that indicates the signature of the document, which would help prevent unauthorized changes. Erik brings up the question of who should be responsible for verifying the signature and discusses the implications of having signed versus unsigned documents. He suggests that the emphasis should be on signing the Helm chart and Docker image to ensure their integrity. Phil agrees and highlights the importance of allowing some user modifications while still maintaining security.

**Non-Root Containers and Elevated Permissions** -
Phil inquires with Merrill about the integration of non-root containers and the necessity of supporting application vendors in deploying operators. Merrill acknowledges that this issue is currently under discussion, emphasizing the importance of establishing a mechanism to approve elevated permissions. 
They also discuss the potential risks associated with operators manipulating manifests, highlighting the need for a way to clearly describe security requirements. Additionally, Himanshu points out that Kubernetes offers options for controlling privileges and suggests that Margo should abstract these controls for better management.

**Resource Requirements and Node Feature Discovery** -
Phil and Merrill discuss the importance of defining the resource requirements for applications and the potential implementation of node feature discovery. Phil expresses concerns about the inconsistencies in node feature discovery tags across different manufacturers, highlighting the challenges this presents. He suggests beginning with basic resource requirements and gathering feedback from various use cases. Additionally, Phil emphasizes the need to address node feature discovery in the initial release and invites others to join the discussion.

**Service Exposure and Collision Prevention**
Phil and Deepak discuss various methods for exposing applications in Kubernetes, such as services, ingress controllers, and the newly introduced Gateway API. Phil emphasizes the importance of preventing conflicts when exposing services and the potential complexity involved in abstracting the specifics of service exposure. Deepak brings up the challenge of managing multiple applications with overlapping service requirements and the necessity for proper configuration. Phil proposes that Margo should offer guidelines or a specific approach to effectively handle service exposure and prevent conflicts.

**Operator Support and Custom Resource Definitions**
Phil emphasizes the importance of revisiting the topic of operator support and explains the intention behind it. He points out that Liam is not on the call and suggests discussing this topic again in a future meeting. Additionally, Phil reminds everyone about a pull request for reorganizing the application observability content and requests a review to facilitate its merging. He concludes the meeting by thanking everyone for their time and inviting any further topics for discussion.

### Action Items
- [ ] Investigate further the challenges around signing the application definition and the level of modifications allowed.
- [ ] Explore the options for exposing applications and develop guidelines or a specific approach to handle this.
- [ ] Revisit the topic of operators and what Margo needs to support in that area.
