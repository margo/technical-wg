   - The primary focus was on managing encryption keys and secrets for securing data transmissions.
   - Discussion on whether to rotate encryption keys regularly or maintain a long-standing set of keys.
   - Need to provide a method for devices to encrypt data using a key that ensures only the device can decrypt it.
* Authentication and Access:
   - Consideration of how to authenticate devices and users to access private registries and pull application packages.
   - Potential use of JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authenticating users and devices to access application registries.
   - The need for a secure mechanism to handle multiple credentials for different registries and applications.
* Onboarding and Device Management:
   - The onboarding process for devices includes setting up and managing keys.
   - The importance of assigning tenant IDs during the onboarding process to ensure secure and organized access management.
* Open Questions and Areas for Further Discussion:
   - Who provides the secret to the registry initially?
   - How to securely manage and exchange keys between the app owner, the boss (orchestrator), and the registry.
