### Minutes

The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings. The discussion topics included: 

* Local Registries and Infrastructure Dependencies:
   - Importance of avoiding reliance on public registries to ensure the availability of hosted Docker images and Helm charts.
   - Discussion on different approaches to managing local registries, particularly in scenarios where devices lack internet connectivity.

* Options for Managing Registries:
   - *Option 1: Parameterization in Helm Charts* - Involves modifying Helm charts to change the registry URL. Consensus was that this approach has significant disadvantages, including the need to modify third-party charts, which is not always feasible.
   - *Option 2: Kubernetes Native Mirroring* - More favorable as it doesn't require changes to Helm charts but involves mirroring registries locally.
   - *Option 3: Proxy Configuration* - Considered the most flexible approach, allowing seamless redirection of requests to local registries. This could involve using tools like JFrog Artifactory, which can cache images and charts locally.

* Challenges with Air-Gapped Environments:
   - Discussion on the complexity of supporting fully air-gapped environments where devices cannot access external networks.
   - The need for mechanisms to manually populate local registries or proxies in such scenarios was highlighted.

* Device Onboarding and Configuration:
   - Consideration of how proxy configurations and registry settings could be integrated into the device onboarding process.
   - Importance of ensuring that devices can be easily configured to work with the chosen infrastructure, whether through automated processes or manual configuration.

**Open Items**

   - Define and document various deployment options, including fully connected environments, local repositories, and air-gapped scenarios.
   - Ensure that these deployment options are aligned with the needs of the target customer base.
   - Further research into the feasibility and implementation of proxy solutions, particularly in air-gapped environments.
   - Explore existing tools and their capabilities in supporting the required configurations.
   - Develop a clear understanding of the device requirements for supporting the chosen deployment options.
   - Ensure that these requirements are considered in the ongoing development of the Margo specification.
   - Continue discussions on how to integrate proxy and registry settings into the device onboarding process in future meetings.
