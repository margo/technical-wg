**Arne opens the meeting at 15:00 BST**

### Summary Meeting Notes
The meeting was convened to review and update pull requests about application requirements and device capabilities within the Margo project. Amon's pull request received general approval; however, Sylvano's remains pending further updates. The team deliberated on delineating application requirements and device capabilities, underscoring the significance of resource guarantees for users. A discussion ensued regarding whether to outline minimum resource requirements on a per-component basis or according to deployment profile, with the consensus ultimately favouring the latter. Furthermore, the complexities associated with enforcing resource limits were examined, alongside the need for a generic mechanism to address the diverse hardware and application requirements.

### Action Items
- [ ] Summarise the key points of the discussion and proposals in the GitHub repository.
- [ ] Refine the proposals on application requirements and device capabilities based on the discussion.

### Meeting Minutes

**Review of Pull Requests and Initial Discussion**
Arne reviews Armand's PR, noting it is generally acceptable but requires some changes. He also requests an update from Sylvano regarding his pull request, highlighting feedback from Phil and any modifications made. During the meeting, Arne remarks on the low attendance, likely due to the Easter break, and suggests discussing application requirements and device capabilities, summarising earlier discussions in slides.

**Discussion on Application Requirements and Device Capabilities**
Arne presented slides that beautifully summarise our discussion of application requirements and device capabilities. Armand appreciated the effort to consolidate everything and is eager to see the results! Arne highlighted Phil's suggestion to clearly list application and hardware requirements. He also summarised our discussion under two main headings: discovering potential devices and determining concrete scheduling for apps on those devices.

**Clarification on Application Requirements and Device Capabilities**
Armand emphasised that the fleet manager handles the workflow for filtering devices compatible with workloads. Phil agreed with this approach but noted that the conversation may have changed since the initial discussion. Arne suggested a basic solution focusing on what is necessary, while a more detailed approach might be needed for scheduling apps on devices. Armand and Phil discussed the importance of application developers describing hardware components and the fleet manager's role in filtering devices.

**Resource Requirements and Deployment Profiles**
Arne and Armand discuss minimum resource requirements for components versus deployment profiles. Armand suggests defining these requirements at the deployment profile level to reduce duplication. Phil and Armand agree that the fleet manager should manage the total resource needs of various components, emphasising the importance of capping usage to prevent overcommitment.

**Challenges in Enforcing Resource Limits**
Hey team! Arne discusses the challenges of enforcing resource limits, pointing out that Docker and Kubernetes depend on the OS for resource management. Armand agrees that setting maximum limits can be tricky due to this complexity. Phil suggests making resource limits a configurable option for device managers. Arne emphasises the need for a system that guarantees app developers and operators can rely on these limits!

**Guidelines for Resource Specification**
Nilanjan suggests that resource specifications should indicate the minimum resources required for reasonable performance. Andre questions the value of specifying hardware requirements, as most software typically only lists platform requirements. Meanwhile, Arne and Nilanjan discuss the need for a generic mechanism to address various hardware and application types. At the same time, Deepak and Nilanjan stress the importance of enabling devices to publish their capabilities lexicon and aligning it with application requirements.

**Compliance Testing and User Guarantees**
Andre asks if compliance testing will enforce resource requirements. Armand replies that it will only verify the presence of required values. Arne stresses the need to provide guarantees to users, especially in critical applications. Nilanjan suggests that devices should declare whether resources are guaranteed or provided on a best-effort basis for scheduling. Phil and Armand agree that the fleet manager should use this information to make improved deployment decisions.

**Final Thoughts and Next Steps**
Arne summarizes the discussion, noting the need for a balance between specificity and flexibility in resource requirements.
Armand suggests that the proposals should be documented in a specific location for further refinement.
Arne agrees to summarize the discussion and work on proposals based on the inputs from the meeting.
The meeting concludes with participants expressing their appreciation for the discussion and the need for further collaboration.
