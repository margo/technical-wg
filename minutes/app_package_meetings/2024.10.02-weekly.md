### Minutes

### Summary
The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings. The discussion topics included: 

#### Meeting Summary

The team discussed the progress and challenges in defining application resource requirements and deployment scenarios. 
Merrill reported gaining management's attention for resource allocation. 
Arne proposed aligning device capabilities with application requirements using a JSON-like structure. 
Phil and others emphasized abstracting hardware details for app developers. 
The conversation also covered integrating WebAssembly (WASM) with Kubernetes, emphasizing non-root containers for security. 
The team agreed to document WASM integration and discussed security aspects, including app trust and non-root container requirements, with specific tasks assigned for further development.

#### Minutes in detail

**Updates on Resource Allocation and Management** -
Arne discusses updates to the application description format, focusing on defining required resources.

**Proposal for Resource Requirement Structure** -
Arne explains his proposal to use a similar structure from the JSON document for defining app resources.
He suggests matching device capabilities against minimum resource requirements using specific keys.
Phil and another speaker express concerns about the level of detail and abstraction needed.
Tom suggests associating resource requirements with deployment profiles for different scenarios.

**Discussion on Deployment Profiles and Resource Requirements** -
Phil and Armand discuss the need to define resource requirements for different deployment scenarios.
Tom Counihan shares his experience with Helm charts and the potential overlap with existing configurations.
Armand introduced the Node Feature Discovery (NFD) project, which could help in detecting hardware features.
Phil and others discuss the potential benefits and challenges of using NFD for resource discovery.

**Exploring Kubernetes Operators and Helm Charts** -
Tom and others discuss the integration of WebAssembly (WASM) with Kubernetes and Helm charts.
The group agrees that WASM can run on normal devices and that existing mechanisms like Helm charts are sufficient for now.
Arne suggests preparing documentation on WASM integration through Helm, differentiating between options.
The group agrees to focus on informal documentation and aligning with existing practices.

**Security and Trust in Application Packages** -
Arne reviews security aspects, including handling private repositories and establishing trust in application packages.
Merrill emphasizes the importance of app vendors revealing root access requests.
Julien suggests focusing on non-root containers and making them the default for Margo.
The group discusses the potential need for root containers in specific cases and the importance of device orchestration for hardware configuration.

**Assigning Ownership for Security and Non-Root Containers** -
Arne asks for volunteers to take ownership of the security and non-root container topics.
David expresses interest in managing app trust and digital signatures.
The group agrees to include non-root containers in the specification and discusses the reasoning behind it.
Arne concludes the meeting, suggesting further discussion on these topics in the next meeting.

### Action Items
- [ ] Reach out to Liam and discuss the documentation on Wasm integration with Margo.
- [ ] Follow up on the email from the Linux Foundation regarding the conformance test suite.
- [ ] Take a look at the previous discussions on the security aspects of Margo and provide input.
- [ ] Incorporate the discussion on non-root containers into the Margo specification.
- [ ] Investigate the aspects of app trust, including digital signatures and package bundle management, and provide input.
