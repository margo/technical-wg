Arnie opens the meeting at 15:00 GMT

### Summary Meeting Notes
The meeting centred on refining the application package and deployment profiles in the Margo specification. Arne proposed renaming "application description" to "application definition" and substituting "components" with "workload artefacts." The team emphasised the importance of distinguishing between pre-deployment and runtime stages and suggested implementing a "running" flag for provisioning and deployment. They debated the merits of OCI registries versus Git repositories for application artefacts and highlighted the need for multiple deployment profiles to accommodate various device configurations, citing complex applications that require multiple Helm charts and native Kubernetes artefacts.

### Action Items
- [ ] Review the pull request with the mermaid diagrams and provide feedback.
- [ ]  Clarify the intent around having multiple deployment profiles in the specification.
- [ ] Explore how to best handle the provisioning stage, including the potential use of a "running" flag.

### Minutes 
**Kanban Board Overview and Workload Definition** -
Arne introduces the Kanban board, which is focused on pre-release issues. He defines 'application' as a collection of workloads, while 'workload' refers to software tailored for edge compute devices. Collaborating with Silvana, Arne discusses the differences between these terms and highlights discrepancies in the current application package definition, which omits workloads.

**Proposed Changes to Application Package Definition** -
Arne proposes several terminology changes for clarity in the application package structure: renaming "application description" to "application definition," replacing "components" with "workload artefacts," and updating the term to "compose archive" in the Margo specification. Feedback and discussion on these changes are encouraged.

**Discussion on Workload Artefacts and Deployment Profiles** -
Phil questions the necessity of distinguishing between workload artefacts and workloads, noting that their content is identical. Arne clarifies that artefacts are pre-deployment items, while workloads are runtime items. Stefano likens this differentiation to the distinction between container images and running containers. Erik highlights the need for clarification regarding the number of deployment profiles in the specification.

Karthik questions the application and workload registries, proposing they reference GitHub releases. In response, Arne defines the application package as a folder structure containing a YAML document and deployment profiles. Karthik then suggests adopting an OCI registry for application artefacts to align with established standards. Arne agrees to evaluate the pros and cons of using a Git repository versus an OCI registry.

**Multiple Deployment Profiles and Use Cases** -
High discusses the necessity for multiple deployment profiles to effectively target various device types and configurations. Phil expands on this by emphasising the importance of aligning these profiles with system capabilities such as CPU and memory. Arne recognises the need for ongoing efforts to address device capabilities and requirements, while Armand advocates for the specification to accommodate additional deployment profiles and types.

**Provisioning and Deployment Stages** -
Stefano presents a mermaid diagram to depict the stages of packaging, provisioning, and deployment, proposing a flag to indicate whether an application is provisioned but not yet deployed. Erik highlights the complexities of pre-staging applications, emphasising the need for a declarative approach. Additionally, Andre mentions Blue-Green deployments and rolling updates as common strategies for application updates.

**Feedback on Terminology and Proposed Changes** -
Stefano invites feedback on the pull request to refine terminology and concepts. Armand clarifies that providers are the components managing the workload, aligning with the technical lexicon. Erik stresses the importance of clear, consistent terminology to prevent confusion. Arne recommends providing feedback through the pull request on GitHub.

**Closing Remarks and Next Steps** -
Arne suggests checking Liam's availability to discuss his contributions to the working group. Armand highlights ongoing efforts to address feedback from the PM group and prioritise requirements. The meeting concludes with a plan to review the pull request and schedule the next session to continue the discussion.
