## Exposing application endpoint - 20 Nov 2024

### Attendees:
* Arne Br√∂ring (Siemens AG)
* Adam Qiu (Emerson)
* Philip Presson (ABB Switzerland Ltd, Group) - Chair

### Summary meeting notes
The team discussed the challenges of exposing application endpoints in Kubernetes deployments, focusing on service discovery and potential conflicts with port and hostname usage. They explored various methods, including ingress routes, load balancers, and the new Gateway API, noting the need for configurable ingress route information. Key issues identified include port and hostname conflicts, protocol mismatches, and reserved ports. They proposed creating an issue to document these problems and potential solutions, emphasizing the importance of understanding the issues before proposing solutions. The team also discussed the impact of upcoming holidays on meeting schedules.

### Minutes

**Scheduling and Initial Discussion** - Phil and Arne discuss the meeting schedule. Phil mentions that he did not receive the initial meeting invite, and Arne confirms that Deepak started the topic. 
Phil suggests holding calls every other week to help maintain motivation and participation. He notes that Liam is interested in joining and acknowledges his own challenges in managing the calls.
During the conversation, they identify two main issues: service discovery and application vendors exposing endpoints on the ports or hostnames being utilized. 
Phil emphasizes the importance of enumerating the problems and fully understanding them before working on solutions. He then introduces Adam to the call.

**Input and Use Cases** - Adam discusses the necessity of a programmatic or automatic approach for discovering and publishing endpoints after deployment. Phil asks about Adam's methods for exposing endpoints in Kubernetes deployments. Adam outlines several techniques, including ingress routes, load balancers, and API gateways. 
Additionally, Adam emphasizes the importance of interoperability and highlights that Margo must support various deployment methods and frameworks.

**Expertise and Potential Conflicts** - Phil discusses deploying applications to Kubernetes and using ingress routes for exposing endpoints.
Phil raises concerns about potential conflicts when using ingress controllers, such as multiple people using the same hostname or port. Adam discusses their approach to defining port mappings and handling conflicts at runtime, emphasizing the need for minimal information in the app definition.
Arne and Phil discuss the potential for conflicts in deployments and the need for Margo to provide a way to configure ingress route information.

**Exploring Solutions and Documentation** - Adam suggests using simple Docker and Kubernetes use cases to identify problems and potential solutions.
Phil proposes creating an issue for everyone to document potential problems and consolidate information for the next call. The team discusses the different ways to expose applications using Docker Compose, ingress controllers, load balancers, and the new Gateway API in Kubernetes.
Arne and Phil agree to document the potential problems first and then explore solutions, with Phil emphasizing the need to understand the whole picture before proposing solutions.

**Next Steps and Meeting Conclusion** - The team agrees to update the issue with their findings and proposals for solving the identified problems.

### Action Items
- [ ] Research and document the various ways of exposing applications in Kubernetes and the potential problems that can arise.
- [ ] Consolidate the information on the identified problems and potential solutions and review it in the next call.
