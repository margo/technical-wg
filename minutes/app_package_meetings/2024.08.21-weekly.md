### Minutes

The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings. The discussion topics included: 

* Prototype Demonstration
   - Demonstration of a prototype showing different options for deploying software packages, focusing on air-gapped environments and the role of registries.
   - Discussion of how to manage software deployments, particularly in scenarios where the application source is hosted locally rather than directly pulling from the cloud.

* Deployment Options for Air-Gapped Devices:
     - Two primary approaches were explored: 
       1. **Registry Parameterization:** Application vendors create Helm charts that allow for flexible registry configurations, enabling end-users to redirect deployments to a local registry.
       2. **Mirror Registry Configuration:** Setting up device-level configurations to redirect container pulls from a public source (like GitHub or Docker Hub) to a local registry without requiring changes to the application Helm charts.

   - Air-Gapped Definitions:
     - The concept of "air-gapped" was clarified, noting that it could refer to either the complete isolation of a factory or specific devices within a factory.
     - Different interpretations of "air-gapped" environments were discussed, including scenarios where devices intermittently connect to local networks via controlled methods (e.g., technicianâ€™s laptops).

   - Impact on Application Developers:
     - The discussion highlighted the trade-offs between requiring app vendors to create fully configurable Helm charts versus relying on end-users to manage mirror configurations.
     - There was agreement that both approaches are valid, but the implementation decision would depend on the relationship between the app vendor, the end user, and the system integrators.

* Technical Considerations:
   - The challenges of managing dependencies, especially for open-source components, were noted. App vendors might bundle dependencies or allow end-users to manage them via local registries.
   - Concerns about licensing and the implications of local mirroring were raised, particularly in environments where compliance and control over software usage are critical.

**Open Items:**
   - Issue Creation and Discussion: Armand and team will summarize the conversation and create an issue for further exploration of the discussed deployment options.
   - Clarification on Margo Specifications: The team will continue refining the Margo app package specifications to ensure flexibility for both direct and mirrored deployments.
   - Engage with Application Developers: Gatheer feedback from application developers to understand their preferences and challenges regarding registry configurations.
