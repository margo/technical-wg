### General Meeting Notes
The team discussed the progress and challenges of application signing, particularly for Docker, noting slower-than-expected progress. They debated the scope of Docker support, considering both holistic and specific device capabilities. A deadline for a pre-release version was mentioned, emphasizing the need for security. The conversation shifted to application endpoint discovery, with a focus on service discovery and avoiding conflicts. The use of operators in Margo was debated, with concerns about infrastructure vs. application responsibilities. The team agreed on the need for further research and potential breakout groups to address these complex issues.

### Minutes
**Application Signing and Docker Support** -
Merrill updates on the application signing, noting slower progress but active work, mainly focusing on Docker support.
The group discussed the scope of Docker support, considering both holistic and specific Docker device capabilities.
Merrill highlights the need to parameterize and secure environment variables for signing and the challenges of securely delivering packages.
**Deadlines and Scope of Preview Release** -
Phil inquires about deadlines for the application signing work.
Merrill acknowledges the need for a deadline but notes it has yet to be set, emphasizing the importance of security.
Phil and Merrill discuss the scope of the preview release, considering the inclusion of Docker app deployment and signing aspects.
Merrill mentions the security concerns raised in the proposal, suggesting that pre-release feedback could help refine the final version.
Phil and Merrill agree on the need for feedback and continued conversation to address security and deployment mechanisms.

**Application Endpoint Discovery and Service Discovery** -
Phil introduces the topic of application endpoint discovery, mentioning Deepak's upcoming updates.
Discussion on the two aspects: how applications expose themselves and service discovery for deployed applications.
Phil suggests forming a small group to explore options and define problems more clearly.
Liam expresses interest in involving Taylor Thomas from his team, who has experience with Helm and WASM Cloud CLI.
Liam highlights the importance of handling secrets and other design patterns from the Kubernetes world.

**Operators and Margo Integration**
Liam presents his document on operators, explaining their role in deploying software on Kubernetes.
Phil questions the role of Margo in supporting operators, considering it an implementation detail.
Discussion on the potential need for specific operators like the certificate manager and the challenges of deploying them.
Stephen B. suggests that the cluster, not the application, should manage infrastructure-related operators like cert managers.
Phil and Stephen B. discuss the complexity of managing operators and the potential for Margo-specific custom resources to abstract these complexities.

**Ingress Controllers and Networking Challenges**
Phil and Stephen B. discuss the challenges of ingress controllers and the need for consistent annotations across different Kubernetes distributions.
Mention of the Gateway API for Kubernetes as a potential solution to the annotation variability issue.
Stephen B. suggests narrowing the scope of Margo's support to HTTP and TCP in the initial preview release.
Phil and Stephen B. agree on the need for further discussion and research.
Himanshu highlights the need for prescriptive approaches to ensure consistent orchestration and deployment.

**Final Comments and Next Steps**
Phil summarizes the key points discussed, including the complexity of Kubernetes and the need for detailed follow-up.
Stephen B. emphasizes the importance of understanding application and cluster expectations to address variability.
Phil suggests syncing with Armin and Arm to explore these topics further.
Erik inquires about the availability of meeting videos, and Phil directs him to the LFX portal for past meeting recordings.
The meeting concludes with a plan to watch the video and discuss the challenging topics.

### Action Items
- [ ] Liam will engage Taylor Thomas to provide feedback and suggestions on the application endpoint discovery and service exposure topic.
- [ ] Phil to organize a small subgroup to further discuss the application endpoint discovery and service exposure topic.
- [ ] The group to sync up with Armin and Armand to discuss the networking and service exposure challenges as a potential area for further research and investigation.
