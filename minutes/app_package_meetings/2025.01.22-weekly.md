**Arne opens the meeting at 15:00**

### Summary meeting notes
The team explored the integration of WASM via Helm and finalized the app package definition with Link ML. Arne noted inconsistencies between the Git version and the generated markdown, particularly highlighting missing descriptions and irregular naming conventions. Silvano underlined the importance of Link ML in maintaining uniformity. Armand inquired about the approval of tools and proposed a pull request to implement corrections. The discussion then transitioned to a sequence diagram illustrating the application deployment workflow, which included concerns regarding device capabilities, health monitoring, and the workload fleet manager's function. The team concurred in dividing the diagram into smaller sections for more precise understanding and to emphasize Margo-specific details.

### Minutes
**Project Overview and Initial Discussions**
Liam states that an example work will be provided shortly while Arne verifies the wasm integration status via Helm. Arne elaborates on how he utilized link ml to outline classes and attributes for the app package definition, pointing out differences between the Git version and the produced markdown version.

**Link ML and Validation Process**
Armand questions how link ML helps identify inconsistencies, while Arne explains its function as a validation and comparison tool. Silvano contributes that link ML guarantees consistent naming throughout the document, aiding Arne in resolving discrepancies. Arne intends to submit a pull request with corrections, regardless of whether link ML is officially adopted. Armand and Silvano discuss the link between ML's potential benefits and applications, pondering its internal use even if it remains unofficial.

**Tooling and Standardization**
Armand suggests standardizing tool sets and emphasizes the need for community approval for using link ML. Silvano proposes postponing the decision on link ML until a conclusion is reached, suggesting that it can be kept internal if it isn't officially adopted. They also discuss the need for uniform templates across various specification sections to maintain consistency. Arne adds that the whole specification requires refinement for consistency, mainly because new terms are being introduced.

**Technical Lexicon and Specification Cleanup**
Armand raises a pull request from Josh about the technical lexicon and recommends exploring it further. Arne recognizes the possible requirement for creating the technical lexicon and the difficulties in ensuring consistency throughout the specification. Silvano proposes utilizing link ml to maintain a uniform glossary, which can be produced from a single source. Armand stresses the necessity of avoiding redundant work and syncs the current tasks with the forthcoming discussion on personas and the technical lexicon.

**Application Package Definition and Margo YAML**
Arne reviews the Margo YAML file, highlighting its importance in defining the application package and inviting feedback on its accuracy. Armand proposes substituting "Margo YAML" with "application package definition" to improve clarity. Merrill inquires about a workflow diagram, prompting Arne to outline the current status and intentions for incorporating it into the diagram. The discussion between Armand and Arne focuses on clarifying the purpose of the Margo YAML and its relationship to the overall specification.

**Sequence Diagram and Workflow**
Arne showcases a sequence diagram that details the workflow, beginning with the end user choosing a workload from the catalog. Participants, including Armand, offer feedback to enhance the diagram, proposing various improvements and clarifications. Deepak and Segev question aspects of the flow, emphasizing the necessity for a unique ID for application deployment definitions and the function of the workload fleet manager. Armand and Arne conversely emphasize the significance of filtering devices according to workload requirements while advocating for a centralized source of truth regarding device information.

**Device Capabilities and Fleet Manager**
Tom Counihan and other participants discuss how the workload fleet manager oversees device capabilities and maintains their health. Armand highlights the importance of updating the fleet manager's database with device capabilities during onboarding. Erik brings up the importance of tracking changes in device capabilities and the necessity for persistence in the fleet manager's database. Tom Counihan proposes including a unique ID for application deployment definitions to facilitate accurate filtering and management of device information.

**Final Discussions and Next Steps**
Armand and Arne address the necessity of emphasizing vendor-specific components in the diagram and the significance of distinguishing Margo-specific processes from broader workflows. Armand recommends dividing the diagram into smaller parts for improved clarity, suggesting that they reference these in the specifications. Arne wraps up the meeting by expressing gratitude to all attendees and confirming the date for the next meeting. Before concluding, participants casually discuss personal experiences and future plans.

### Action Items
- [ ] Arne will submit a pull request with the corrections identified through the Link ML tool comparison.
- [ ] The group to discuss the potential standardization of Link ML usage and the associated tooling across the project.
- [ ] The group to review the sequence diagram and provide feedback on the overall flow and the responsibilities of the various components.
