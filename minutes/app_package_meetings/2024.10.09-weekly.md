### Meeting Summary
The focus group discussed the application package definition for Margo, emphasizing the need for a clear, minimal set of requirements. Key points included the importance of device capabilities, such as GPU models and CUDA versions, and the potential redundancy with existing orchestration systems like Kubernetes. The group debated the necessity of detailed hardware specifications versus high-level attributes like CPU, memory, and storage. They also considered the role of node feature discovery and the potential for device vendors to contribute matching rules. The consensus was to start with minimal requirements and expand based on use cases and feedback.

### Minutes of Meeting

**Demonstration of Application Package Definition** - 
Segev explains the demonstration he is working on, comparing it to Phil Parson's work on Kubernetes.
Segev mentions meeting with Arne, Phil, and other Schneider members to create a plan.
Segev states that they have already started implementing part of the plan and have included it in their sprint.
Arne asks for more specifics on what Segev's team is implementing, and Segev explains the process from application definition to deployment file.

**Discussion on Application Description Format Updates** -
Arne brings up the issue of updates on the application description format to include required resources.
Phil discusses the utility of node feature discovery for Kubernetes nodes and the need for a unified list of labels.
Armand explains the current need for a unified place for these labels and the challenges in discovering them.
Phil and others discuss the need for a way to inform end users about compatible devices based on application requirements.

> Based on the discussion, there are a few key points regarding how the WAS can effectively utilize the information provided in the Margo app specification for placement decisions:
> 1. The WAS should focus on high-level, abstract requirements first, such as CPU, memory, and storage needs. This allows for more flexibility and compatibility across different device types.
> 2. The WAS can use a key-value pair mechanism in the Margo YAML to capture specific hardware requirements, if needed, but the semantics of these fields need to be clearly defined.
> 3. The WAS should avoid trying to replicate the scheduling logic of Kubernetes or other orchestration systems. Its role should be to provide information to the end-user or the orchestrator, not to make the final placement decisions.
> 4. The WAS may need to provide warnings or guidance to the end-user if there are potential mismatches between the application requirements and the available device capabilities, but should not block the deployment.
> 5. The WAS should be flexible enough to accommodate evolving hardware and software requirements over time, rather than locking the application to very specific hardware configurations.
> The overall approach seems to be striking a balance between providing useful information to the WAS, while avoiding overly complex or restrictive requirements that could limit the application's portability and compatibility.

**Concerns About Redundancy and Specificity** -
Himanshu is concerned about redundancy in orchestration systems like Helm or Docker Compose.
Himanshu suggests abstracting high-level properties like CPU, memory, storage, and device types.
Phil and others discuss the balance between simplicity and the need for specificity in hardware requirements.
Tom Counihan and Merrill express concerns about the potential for errors and the complexity of specifying specific hardware requirements.
> The key considerations in balancing specificity and simplicity when defining hardware and application requirements are:
> 1. Avoid over-specification: Defining very specific hardware requirements (e.g., exact GPU model, CPU features) can make the application too tightly coupled to a particular hardware configuration, reducing its portability and compatibility.
> 2. Provide enough information for informed decisions: At the same time, the requirements should be detailed enough to allow the WAS and end-users to make informed decisions about which devices are suitable for running the application.
> 3. Accommodate evolving hardware: Hardware capabilities and specifications can change over time, so the requirements should be flexible enough to handle newer versions or models of hardware that may provide the same or better functionality.
> 4. Balance between minimum and recommended requirements: The application can define both minimum and recommended hardware requirements, allowing end-users to understand the baseline needs as well as the optimal configuration.
> 5. Leverage existing standards and frameworks: The application requirements should align with existing standards and frameworks (e.g., Kubernetes node feature discovery) to leverage common terminology and understanding.
> 6. Prioritize critical requirements: Focus on defining the most critical hardware requirements (e.g., CPU, memory, storage) first, and consider adding more specific requirements (e.g., GPU, network) as optional or secondary.
> 7. Provide guidance, not strict enforcement: The WAS should use the requirements to provide guidance and warnings to end-users, rather than strictly enforcing the placement of applications on devices that match the requirements.
> The goal is to find the right balance between providing enough information for informed decision-making and maintaining the flexibility and portability of the application across a wide range of hardware configurations.

**Potential Solutions and Next Steps** -
Erik suggests a distinction between minimum requirements and recommended requirements for applications.
Julien and others discuss the importance of precise semantics for the fields describing hardware and application requirements.
Himanshu suggests a key-value pair mechanism for flexibility in the Margo YAML.
Phil proposes collecting use cases to understand the actual needs and requirements better.

**Final Thoughts and Action Items** -
Armand emphasizes the importance of device capabilities and the need for a framework to expose and discover device features.
Phil suggests focusing on minimal requirements initially and extending based on use cases.
Merrill stresses the need for end-user input and participation in these discussions.
Arne proposes continuing the discussion over the week and revisiting it in the next teleconference.


**Action Items**
- [ ] Collect specific use cases for hardware requirements that applications may have.
- [ ] Continue discussing the approach for capturing requirements in the next meeting.
