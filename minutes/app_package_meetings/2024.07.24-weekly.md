### Minutes

The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings. The discussion topics included: 

* Device Identifier Requirements:
   - There was a significant discussion about the necessity and characteristics of a device identifier (ID) for device management.
     - Device ID should be immutable and globally unique.
     - Security considerations must be applied when assigning the ID.
     - The ID should be available at the manufacturing stage, with a vendor-specific ID being a possibility.
  
* Onboarding Process:
   - Discussion on the process and requirements for onboarding devices to the management system.
     - Preference for an HTTPS RESTful interface to facilitate automation and bulk device onboarding.
     - The onboarding process should allow the submission of device certificates.
   
* Failover Mechanism (Split Brain Scenario):
   - Addressing how devices should handle loss of communication with their management system.
     - Clarified that the situation described is more accurately termed as a failover rather than split brain.
     - Devices must be able to failover to a backup instance of the device management software.
   
* Initial Communication Methods:
   - Exploring various communication methods for device management.
     - HTTPS RESTful interface as the primary communication method.
     - Consideration for supporting cellular communication.
     - Potential use of out-of-band communication methods, like a secondary interface or serial port.

**Open Items**
   - Document the requirements for the device ID, including its immutability, uniqueness, and security considerations.
   - Specify the initial requirement for an HTTPS RESTful interface that supports device certificate submission.
   - Document the requirement for devices to failover to a backup instance of the device management software when communication is lost.
   - Document the consideration of different communication methods, including HTTPS RESTful, cellular, and out-of-band communication.
