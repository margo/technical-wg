### Minutes

The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings. The discussion topics included: 

* Discussion on Application Manifest and Terminology:
   - Agreement to remove the "application manifest" section and place it in a different section with examples.
   - Decision to use the term "application package component" instead of "application manifest."
   - Consideration of using "deployment type" or "deployment configuration" as alternative terminology.

* Metadata Section Updates:
   - Discussion on including a set of tags in the metadata section for easier search and categorization in the marketplace.
   - Agreement to add tags, potentially refining the term later if needed.

* Deployment Types and Future-Proofing:
   - Concern about future-proofing the specification to accommodate new deployment types like WebAssembly or virtual machines.
   - Proposal to restructure the schema to use a dictionary for deployment types, making it easier to add new types without changing the schema.
   - Agreement on defining deployment types centrally to avoid confusion.

* Docker Compose Specifics:
   - Need for further discussion on Docker Compose requirements, including security and versioning.
   - Consideration of feedback from groups planning to use Docker Compose to ensure their needs are met.

* Parameter and Resource Requirement Updates:
   - Presentation of updates to the parameter section and resource requirements.
   - Decision to defer the resource requirements update until alignment with the device capability side is achieved.

**Open Items**

   - Update the description and terminology to reflect the agreed terms "deployment configuration."
   - Add a set of tags to the metadata section for categorization and search purposes.
