### Minutes

The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings. The discussion topics included: 

* Validation Mechanism:
   - Discussion on whether the validation mechanism for required fields should be handled by the UI or the backend schema.
   - Suggestion to have a default value for required fields if the UI is to handle it.
* Access Tokens for Security:
   - Introduction of access tokens to manage secure API calls and lifecycle management of application instances.
   - The importance of creating and managing access tokens consistently across various components like the portal, application orchestrator, and runtime environments.
* Lifecycle Management:
   - Explanation of the sequence of creating application instances, involving the portal, orchestrator, and runtime environments.
   - Access tokens are necessary at different stages: instance creation, interaction with orchestrators, and runtime environments.
* Security Concerns:
   - Ensuring access tokens are managed securely, including their rotation and expiration.
   - Multiple components, including applications, may need access tokens to interact with each other securely.

**Open Items:**

   - Decide whether the UI or backend schema will handle the validation mechanism for required fields.
   - If handled by the UI, consider implementing default values for required fields.
   - Develop a strategy for managing access tokens across all components.
   - Ensure access tokens can be rotated and have an expiration mechanism for security.
   - Bring the access token management and security discussion to the working group for more detailed planning and alignment.
