The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings. The discussion topics included: 

* Editing and Consistency in Documentation:
   - Discussion on the bolding of text and structuring of deployment specifications.
   - Decision to potentially align the headings and examples across different sections for consistency.
* Examples in Application Package Specifications:
   - Current inconsistency in the number of examples between package and application specs.
   - Decision to standardize examples: either have one or two examples consistently across the documents.
   - Agreement to use similar examples for different parts to maintain uniformity.
* Profinet Example Development:
   - Need to elaborate the P&ID diagram for Profinet to align with the detailed OPC UA example.
   - Suggestion to create a consistent use case (e.g., pick and place example) for both Profinet and OPC UA.
   - Armand Craig tasked with developing a more detailed Profinet example, focusing on a motor control process.
* API Examples:
   - Discussion on the difficulty of providing detailed API examples for Profinet due to its low-level nature.
   - Agreement to provide high-level command and status examples instead.

**Open Items:**
   - Arne Bröring to check and align the headings and example structures across the deployment and API sections.
   - Armand Craig to elaborate on the P&ID diagram for Profinet, ensuring it matches the level of detail in the OPC UA example.
   - Create a detailed motor control process example for Profinet, including high-level API commands and status readbacks.
   - Armand Craig to search for and provide example APIs for the URL.
