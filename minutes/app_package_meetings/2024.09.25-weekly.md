### Minutes

The call was recorded and is available to Members at https://openprofile.dev/my-meetings. The discussion topics included: 

**Meeting Summary**
The focus group discussed integrating WASM with Margo, considering three paths: Helm chart integration, Kubernetes operators, and native integration. They agreed to prioritize Helm and Docker Compose documentation first. Andreas proposed an API for managing WASM lifecycles, which was debated for its scope. The group also discussed local registries, device capabilities, and application requirements. They reviewed the need for a conformance test suite and security concerns for Docker Compose. Action items included documenting Helm integration, updating device requirements, and reviewing the local registries proposal.

**Minutes of Meeting**

**Margo Project Overview and Initial Discussion**
Arne mentioned the need to review the roadmap and discuss the integration of new items. He also noted a chat message from Intel about the complexity of taking on additional tasks. Arne asked for opinions on continuing with the discussed items.

**Discussion on Integration Paths**
Liam suggested three paths for consideration: integrating with Helm charts, Kubernetes operators, and native integration. He stresses the importance of each path and recommends documenting the current app integration with Margo. Liam also talks about the potential of Kubernetes operators and the importance of seeking input from Kubernetes experts. He mentions the risk of scope creep with the third path and recommends prioritizing the first two paths.

**Phased Approach and Helm Integration**
Liam is in favor of a phased approach, beginning with simpler integrations such as Docker Compose and Helm. Arne clarifies the integration paths and confirms that the first path is Helm integration. Liam explains the compatibility with WASM Cloud and emphasizes the importance of documenting these integrations. Liam also discusses the potential of Kubernetes operators and their relevance to Margo.

**Kubernetes Operators and Device Classes**
Liam explains the significance of Kubernetes operators and their role in application management. Armand agrees with Liam and stresses the importance of having a well-defined stance on operators in Margo. Armand also talks about the potential inclusion of a new device class for running native WASM workloads. Arne and Liam agree to document the current integrations and explore the third option in the future.

**Assignment of Tasks and Roadmap Updates**
Arne assigns Liam to document the Helm integration and contribute to the Margo specification. Armand has agreed to update the device requirements project to include the new device class. During the review of the roadmap, Arne mentioned future tasks such as compliance certification, mixed deployment profiles, and security testing. Arne also asked Andreas from Siemens to describe his proposal for an app API certification.

**App API Specification and Orchestration**
Andreas presents his draft for an app API specification, which focuses on managing lifecycle and instantiating apps. The group discusses the scope of the API and its alignment with existing Margo specifications. Andreas explains that the API's role is to provide information about available apps and to deploy them. Armand suggests a follow-up meeting to discuss the API in more detail and ensure alignment with ongoing work.

**Local Registries and Application Inscription Format**
Arne mentioned the need for a review of the proposal for local registries. He discussed the approach to parameterization and redirection of artifacts to local registries. Arne and Armand agreed to document their concerns and review the proposal in more detail. Arne also updated the roadmap to include the application inscription format and device capabilities.

**Docker Compose Security and Conformance Testing**
Merrill discussed the investigation into Docker Compose security and the need for a conformance test suite. Armand and Merrill agreed to revisit the work item and address security concerns. Merrill mentioned the need for internal support and discussions with security architects. Arne and Armand discussed the importance of a unified approach to conformance testing and the role of reference implementations.

**Reference Implementations and Next Steps**
Armand stresses the importance of having reference implementations to provide guidance for app vendors and orchestration software. Arne and Armand talk about the possibility of various working groups creating reference implementations. Armand proposes arranging a follow-up meeting with David Wolf to go over the conformance test suite and its implementation. Arne and Armand agree to keep the discussions going and make sure they align with the ongoing work.

**Action Items**
- [ ] @Sean Mcilroy - Reach out to David Wolf to follow up on the conformance test suite discussion.
- [ ] Establish a plan for a unified reference implementation across the Margo working groups.
- [ ] Document the Wasm integration approach using Helm.
- [ ] Investigate adding a new device class for lightweight, Wasm-based devices.
- [ ] Follow up with Andreas on the App API specification proposal and how it aligns with the existing Margo work.
- [ ] Review the local registries' work and document the security aspects that need to be addressed.
