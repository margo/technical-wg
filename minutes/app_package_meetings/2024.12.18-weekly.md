Significant updates included pinpointing challenges related to application endpoint discovery, with proposals still awaiting review. Schneider's commitments, including evaluating Docker Compose and app trust, are at various stages, with some advancements noted. The discussion regarding non-root containers underscored the importance of additional internal discussions. The team consented to adjust expectations for the preview release, taking into account resource declaration and WASM integration. Silvano presented Link ML for formalizing specifications, enhancing consistency and validation. The team aims to finalize these elements in the upcoming workshop in January.

### Minutes

**Discussion on Schneider's Commitments**
Arne inquires about Julian's updates regarding Schneider's commitments, specifically the Docker Compose evaluation and app trust. Julian provides information on internal code reviews and advancements in app trust but has no updates concerning non-root containers. Arne and Julian engage in a discussion about the history and specifics of the non-root container issue. Meanwhile, Silvano and Arne talk about the current status of the non-root container issue and consider possible next steps.

**Resource Requirements and Preview Release**
The group discussed defining the necessary resources for the preview release of the application. Philip and Christian engage in a debate about whether this feature should be included in the preview. Arne proposes clear communication regarding the feature's current status and potential for future integration to manage expectations. The team reaches a consensus on the importance of establishing a middle ground, agreeing to create a document that outlines the feature's status and future intentions.

**WASM Integration and Reference Implementation**
Arne and Christian discuss incorporating WASM into Margo and exploring various integration methods. Christian proposes leveraging the existing OCI infrastructure for the WASM integration. Philip and Christian concur on the necessity of documenting the WASM integration in the upcoming preview release. Arne intends to divide the WASM integration issue into distinct tasks and refresh the project board accordingly.

**Security and Non-Root Containers**
Arne asks about the current state of security issues, such as app trust and non-root containers. The group plans to begin discussions in January to develop the reference implementation. Arne presents Silvano's contributions to Link ML for specification and tooling, which aid in formalizing and validating specifications. Silvano and others outline the advantages of utilizing Link ML for Margo, such as enhanced specification consistency and automated validation checks.

**Final Discussions and Closing Remarks**
The team reviews the preview release schedule and the planned workshop for January. Arne inquired about any further discussion topics, and the group replied that there were no additional points.

**Action Items**
- [ ] Document the "required resources by applications" topic as future work in an appendix or disclaimer for the preview release.
- [ ] Split the Wasm integration issue and move the first point (straightforward integration) to the "In Progress" column while listing the other points as future work.
- [ ] Present the work on using LinkML for the application package definition specification in the larger group during the Thursday calls.
