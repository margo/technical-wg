meeting minutes validated without changes.
  

**Update on optional Margo gathering @ OSS Vienna, Sept 2024**

* A Margo Meet&Greet event will be planned. participation is optional. Intent : facilitate networking between Margo contributors, participating to OSS, and provide opportunity to interested individuals from other  open source projects to discover Margo & network
* Burson still checking if booth crawl space @ OSS would be good fit to also organize a “Poster” session on Margo (Storm’s suggestion)  
* Target date: Sunday 15th September, afternoon/evening. Burson to futher work out details.

**review & discuss Timeline & Scope of the TWG activities**

Open discussion around current velocity, aligment with announced timeline (launch & introduciton presentation) and related challenges.
* Concerns raised about mismatch between communicated timeline (first tangible release withing 6-12 monhts) and observed velocity.  
* Need identified to put in place a leader/owner of the reference implemenation 

 **Observations**  
* Hurdle: Only 3 Margo members have assigned their CLA manager(s). (Rockwell Automation, Siemens, ABB)

* Some recently joined members are accelerating their internal processes to allocate their contributors (e.g. Intel)
* consensus to monitor progress in biweekly SC-TWG calls after having defined how to measure velocity (KPI’s ). Dependency : CLA managers in place for all members.

 **Actions**
* All members to finalize ASAP the CLA mamager assignment.  
* Focus group leaders to include in their focus group objectives task to create proposal for concerned part of the reference implementation.
* organize a virtual workshop for Steerco and Tehcnical WG leads 
   *  Objective : how to live Margo's code-first pattern and find consensus on 12 month scope and associated timeline, based on resources available in the community: articulate a realistic timeline for deliverables, acknowledging the nature of open-source projects, and finding a balance with timeline expectations from the target audience/market. 
   * When : as soon as feasible. July/August 2024.
   * Suggested topics for discussion: 
     * work performed by member organizations, or outsource work to external dev team (funded by MArgo's perational budget) ?
     * reference implemenation/blueprint demonstratores; Accelerate through small focused teams of coders, rather than big teams. Slice up the work in smaller parts.
  *  Lead: Steerco & TWG chair (Nieuwborg / Craig) to make proposal 

**Other topics**

Specification review by Steerco members in progress (Abbott, Berlin, Callen, Lazaro). Craig identified new priority section, and will share with review team.
