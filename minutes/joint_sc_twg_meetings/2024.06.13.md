* Timeline Suggestion Review Prioritized Backlog (Armand to consolidate and prioritize together with Tech leads):

  _Backlog (13/06/2024):_
  1.	Observability (Berlin, Abbott, Callen & Lazaro volunteered to review)
  2.	Overall specification repo structure: alignment with level 200, website, consistency of lexicon. (Abbott & Nieuwborg volunteered)
  3.	Proposal: ensure typical IT and OT personas @ users (= industrial manufacturers) are considered in specification.


**Read-out on level 200 commentary and User Story + discussion**

**Level 200 commentary** is in final review with SteerCo (review closed Tuesday June 18<sup>th</sup>). Intent to put on the[ www.margo.org](http://www.margo.org/)  website  after marketing WG review and external Tech writer review.

**User story:** recommendation to post as a downloadable asset (pdf?) on[ www.margo.org](http://www.margo.org/) and ensure the readme.md of[ www.github.com/margo](http://www.github.com/margo) is linked to this asset.

TWG considers the User story as a critical asset for any technical collaboration work.
