SteerCo review of proposals pre-draft specification : how, who, timeline…

* Timeline Suggestion Review Prioritized Backlog (Armand to consolidate and prioritize together with Tech leads):

Backlog (13/06/2024) :
1.	Observability (Berlin, Abbott, Callen & Lazaro volunteered to review)
2.	Overall specification repo structure: alignment with level 200, website, consistency of lexicon. (Abbott & Nieuwborg volunteered)
3.	Proposal: ensure typical IT and OT personas @ users (= industrial manufacturers) are considered in specification.
