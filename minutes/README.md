## Margo Technical Meeting Minutes Directory

This directory contains the notes/minutes from all technical working group, focus group, and joint steering/technical meetings. 

### Meeting Agenda Creation

Meeting Agendas for all Technical WG and Focus Group meetings are posted as Issues. The Agenda Issues are generated automatically via GitHub actions. Once the Meeting Agenda has been created, the meeting Chairperson should edit the issue to reflect any discussion items, pull requests, or issues that will be discussed in the meeting. Agenda Issue templates for each meeting can be modified by opening a pull request to the appropriate template(s) located in the .github/workflow directory. 

For ad-hoc meetings, please use the technical working group agenda issue template.

### Meeting Minutes

Minutes should include the meeting date, the name and affiliation of attendees, and a summary of the discussion points and any action items. Minutes from each meeting should be added to the /minutes directory via Pull Request. When opening a PR to add minutes, please use the "Closes" keyword to associate the Minutes PR with the appropriate Agenda Issue.

Minutes PRs will be merged after either 1) the chair has approved the minutes on the PR; 2) the Group has approved the minutes during their next meeting; or 3) the PR has been open for two weeks with no comments.
